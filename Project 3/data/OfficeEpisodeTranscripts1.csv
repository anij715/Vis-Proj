33,1,2,Mr. Brown, Thank you Thank you very much OK Thanks for filling these out and I promise thisll be quick At Diversity Today our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations We believe that 99 of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance
34,1,2,Michael, You know what This is a colorfreezone here Stanley I dont look at you as another race
35,1,2,Mr. Brown, Uh see this is what Im talking about We dont have to pretend were colorblind
36,1,2,Michael, Exactly were not
37,1,2,Mr. Brown, Thats fighting ignorance with more ignorance
38,1,2,Michael, With tolerance
39,1,2,Mr. Brown, No With more ignorance
40,1,2,Michael, Ignorance
41,1,2,Mr. Brown, Right Exactly Uh instead we need to celebrate our diversity
42,1,2,Michael, Lets celebrate
43,1,2,Mr. Brown, Right OK
44,1,2,Michael, Celebrate good times Come on Lets celebrate diversity Right
45,1,2,Mr. Brown, Yes exactly Now heres what were going to do Ive noticed that
46,1,2,Michael, You know what Heres what were going to do Why dont we go around and everybody everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually I will go last Go
47,1,2,Dwight, I have two White and Indian
48,1,2,Mr. Brown, Actually Id prefer not to start that way Michael I would love to have your permission to run this session Can I have your permission
49,1,2,Michael, Yes
50,1,2,Mr. Brown, Thank you very much And it would also help me if you were seated
51,1,2,Michael, OK
52,1,2,Mr. Brown, Thank you OK Now at the start of the session I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace Now what Im going to do is choose one and were going to act it out
53,1,2,Dwight, A few of the ground rules
54,1,2,Michael, Hey hey why dont you run it by me and Ill run it by him
55,1,2,Dwight, OK can we steer away from gay people
56,1,2,Mr. Brown, Um
57,1,2,Dwight, Im sorry Its an orientation Its not a race Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays soparadox
58,1,2,Mr. Brown, Well we only have an hour
59,1,2,Dwight, I figured it would save time
60,1,2,Michael, OK Why dont we just defer to Mr
61,1,2,Mr. Brown, Mr Brown
62,1,2,Michael, Ah Oh right OK First test I will not call you that
63,1,2,Mr. Brown, Well its my name Its not a test OK Um so looking through the cards Ive noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident which is ironic because its the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to Now how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine Very good OK
64,1,2,Michael, How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and groundbreaking and then I go and do the exact same routine same comedic timing and people file a complaint to Corporate Is it because Im white and Chris is black
65,1,2,Mr. Brown, So were going to reenact this with a more positive outcome
66,1,2,Michael, I will play the Chris Rock guy I would like to see someone else pull this off
67,1,2,Mr. Brown, Well lets have someone who wasnt involved in the reenactment
68,1,2,Michael, OK I will play guy listening
69,1,2,Mr. Brown, Great Guy listening Ok anyone else remember
70,1,2,Kevin, I remember
71,1,2,Mr. Brown, Great Youre the Chris Rock guy and youre guy listening
72,1,2,Michael, OK
73,1,2,Michael, Kevin is a great guy Hes a great accountant He is not much of an entertainer
74,1,2,Kevin, Basically there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people Every time the one type wants to have a good time then the other type comes in and makes a real mess
75,1,2,Michael, OK Im sorry Im sorry Hes ruin Hes butchering it Could you just let me  Every time Every time black people want to have a good time some ignant ass  I take care of my kid
76,1,2,Mr. Brown, Wait a second

212,1,3,Dwight, Michael Michael
213,1,3,Michael,  Oh Christ
214,1,3,Dwight, I tried being rational OK And what happened The employees went crazy I got no help from corporate That leaves me with no options

218,1,3,Meredith, Could you mean vg1n Because if you do I want that covered
219,1,3,Dwight, I thought your vg1n was removed during your hysterectomy
220,1,3,Meredith, A uterus is different from a vg1n I still have a vg1n
221,1,3,Dwight, OK great Dermatitis Thank you Angela Ill make sure thats covered OK now Who wrote this hysterical one al fissures
222,1,3,Kevin, Thats a real thing
223,1,3,Dwight, Yeah but no one here has it
224,1,3,Kevin, Someone has it
225,1,3,Kevin, Do you think we should go 
226,1,3,Oscar, I dont know Kevin This is important I dont want  There he is
227,1,3,Kevin, What is he doing
228,1,3,Oscar, I dont know
229,1,3,Oscar, Well
230,1,3,Michael, Well what You could be referring to anything
231,1,3,Oscar, OK the health care plan
232,1,3,Pam, Why did you put Dwight in charge of that He did a horrible job
233,1,3,Michael, Uh Dwight Did you raise benefits
234,1,3,Dwight, I most certainly did not
235,1,3,Michael, Oh come on Thats horrible Aaah Thanks Dwight for a crappy plan Ah Damn Oh mmm I wish I had time to change it but Jan needs it by five and what time is it what time is it  Ah its after five Oh oh its awful So well OK See you guys on Monday
236,1,3,Angela, What about the surprise
237,1,3,Michael, Oh Yes Exactly Thank you Angela for reminding me Terrific Um before I tell everybody what the big surprise is would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is
238,1,3,Stanley, We all think you dont have a surprise
239,1,3,Michael, All right I have some news for you There is a big surprise And here it is Here we go And the big surprise is Brrrrrrrr Drum roll Brrrrrrrr Brrrrrrrr
240,1,3,Michael, When I am backed into a corner that is when I come alive See I learned improve from the greats like um Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles
241,1,3,Michael,  God yeah Ah This
242,1,3,Michael, Robin Williams Oh man would I love to go headtohead with him Oh That would be exciting  Hi Im Mork from Ork Well Im Bork from Spork Nanoo nanoo Jibelee baloobaloo
243,1,3,Dwight, Oh um Jan wants you to call her
0,1,4,Dwight, Michael
1,1,4,Michael, Oh God Dwight come on
2,1,4,Dwight, I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing
3,1,4,Michael, Theres no downsizing
4,1,4,Dwight, I but if there were Id be protected as assistant regional manager
5,1,4,Michael, Assistant to the regional manager Dwight
6,1,4,Dwight, Yeah so I dont have to worry
7,1,4,Michael, Look look look I talked to corporate about protecting the sales staff And they said they couldnt guarantee it if theres downsizing okay
8,1,4,Michael, But theres no downsizing so just dont
9,1,4,Dwight, Bottom line Do I need to be worried
10,1,4,Michael, Mmm mm mm Maybe
11,1,4,Michael, It looks like theres gonna be downsizing And its part of my job but blah I hate it I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that uh I get no pleasure out of saying the words Youre fired  Youre foired Uh youre foired It just makes people sad and an office cant function that way No way  Youre foired I think if I had a catchphrase it would be Youre hired and you can work here as long as you want But thats unrealistic so
12,1,4,Dwight, Its a real shame cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through watercooler gossip than through official memos Which puts me at a disadvantage because I bring my own water to work
13,1,4,Stanley, Whyd you do this
14,1,4,Dwight, I didnt do it What do you mean Oh the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance So what do you guys hear Whats the scuttlebutt
15,1,4,Michael, Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott Now I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam Smile Pam I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up so we can have a little celebration for it Not bad not bad at all All right And the birthday person is drum roll please Here we go who is the birthday birthday person

29,1,4,Angela, What
30,1,4,Phyllis, I was just going to say maybe we could have streamers but thats dumb everybody has streamers Never mind
31,1,4,Angela, No yeah I think thats a good idea
32,1,4,Phyllis, Yeah
33,1,4,Angela, What color do you guys think
34,1,4,Phyllis, Well theres green um blue yellow red
35,1,4,Pam, How about green
36,1,4,Angela, I think green is kind of whoreish
37,1,4,Pam, This was tough I suggested we flip a coin But Angela said she doesnt like to gamble Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldnt smack her
38,1,4,Michael, These are my partyplanning beeyatches Pulled off an amazing 80s party last year Off the hook
39,1,4,Michael, So I was thinking if you havent already got a cake um maybe going for one of those icecream cakes from BaskinRobbins Those are very good Very Delicious
40,1,4,Angela, Merediths allergic to dairy so
41,1,4,Michael, Shes not the only one thats going to be eating it right I think everybody likes icecream cake Its not uh its not just about her so
42,1,4,Pam, It is her birthday
43,1,4,Michael, Mint chocolate chip Thatd be good how about some mint chocolate chip
44,1,4,Dwight, Hey so listen I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance Cause of the downsizing I think an alliance might be a good idea you know Help each other out
45,1,4,Dwight, Do you want to form an alliance with me
46,1,4,Jim, Absolutely I do
47,1,4,Dwight, Good good Excellent OK Now we need to figure out whos vulnerable and whos protected
48,1,4,Jim, At that moment I was so happy I mean everything Dwight does annoys me
49,1,4,Dwight, Did you get your tickets
50,1,4,Jim, To what
51,1,4,Dwight, The gn show 
52,1,4,Jim, And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him but only in ways that could get me arrested And then here he comes and he says No Jim heres a way
53,1,4,Dwight, Theres one other thing and this is important Lets keep this alliance totally a secret Dont tell anyone
54,1,4,Pam, An alliance
55,1,4,Jim, Oh yeah
56,1,4,Pam, What does that even mean

125,2,5,Pam, I made brownies
126,2,5,Angela, And I made cookies Same category
127,2,5,Pam, Im guessing Angelas the one in the neighborhood who gives the trickortreaters some toothbrushes Pennies Walnuts

139,2,5,Dwight, If you want to fire him youre going to have to tell him yourself
140,2,5,Michael, I dont wanna fire Stanley I never said that Im certainly not going to do it myself Get those big baleful eyes staring at me Yikes Just okay just 
141,2,5,Dwight,  Cumberland Mills And how did you get my resume Oh no no Im very flattered Dont get me wrong Im just not sure that its my official resume or if its something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online What does it say under martial arts training Oh Okay Im gonna have to supplement that Could I have your fax number
142,2,5,Dwight, Would I ever leave this company Look Im all about loyalty In fact I feel like part of what Im getting paid for here is my loyalty But if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly Im going wherever they value loyalty the most
143,2,5,Oscar, Oh hey
144,2,5,Ryan, Oh your dress is stuck in the back Kind of just
145,2,5,Oscar, Oh 
146,2,5,Dwight,  So you got the fax So why didnt you add it to the res  What do you mean Of course martial arts training is relevant Oh excuse me I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ Uh yeah I get a little frustrated when Im dealing with incompetence Well you know what You can go to hell too And I will see you there burning Fine Okay oh wait So youll let me know when youve made a decis 
147,2,5,Pam, Jim is really talented And he should be the one whos getting a better job offer Like for real
148,2,5,Pam, Dont take this the wrong way but you should go for that job
149,2,5,Jim, Um its in Maryland
150,2,5,Pam, Yeah but I mean look at the salary And its definitely a step up And a challenge
151,2,5,Jim, Yeah Yeah You know what Maybe maybe I will 
152,2,5,Pam, Jim
153,2,5,Dwight, This is called leveraging an offer  Michael can I talk to you for a moment
154,2,5,Michael, Oh God
155,2,5,Dwight, I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills
156,2,5,Michael, Fantastic
157,2,5,Dwight, And I turned it down
158,2,5,Michael, What That wouldve solved all my problems
159,2,5,Dwight, Out of loyalty to this company
160,2,5,Michael, Oh you idiot
161,2,5,Dwight,  so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially
162,2,5,Michael, If you left I wouldnt have to fire anybody
163,2,5,Dwight, But then you wouldnt have me here
164,2,5,Michael, Big deal Oh it wouldve worked out so well Can you get it back

167,2,5,Dwight, I cant I I suppose I coul no They never really made me an offer anyway
168,2,5,Michael, Wohahah Why are you torturing me God
169,2,5,Jim, Honestly I dont think Michael has the slightest clue of who hes gonna fire I think he keeps hoping that someones going to volunteer Uh or be run over by a bus before the deadline But in the end really whats going to happen is its gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall And therein lies the true essence of his charisma
170,2,5,Michael,  Can I speak to you a minute
171,2,5,Jim, Um yes
172,2,5,Jim, Michael I really didnt mean to

217,2,8,Dwight, I have a copy of your key
218,2,8,Jan, Thats a serious offense

220,2,8,Jan, Oh Michael for God sakes
221,2,8,Dwight, Id also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace
222,2,8,Michael, Ok third wheel why dont you do that

61,2,9,Dwight, Does he have access to their medical records
62,2,9,Pam, Ummmm
63,2,9,Dwight, I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records As a volunteer sheriff I can look up anyones psychiatric records or surgical histories Yeast infections There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory

22,2,10,Jim, So this year for the first time ever I got Pam in Secret Santa And I got her this teapot which I know she really wants so she can make tea at her desk But Im also going to stuff it with some inside jokes Like this is my high school yearbook photo She saw it at the party and it really makes her laugh Not sure why What else  ooh This is a hot sauce packet She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup And it was really funny so I kept the other two  This would take a little too long to explain so I wont And this is the card Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel
23,2,10,Angela, Is there anything were missing Phyllis you got the lights
24,2,10,Phyllis, Yes I got those cute little ones  Do you think I should have gotten the big ones
25,2,10,Angela, Well see
26,2,10,Ryan, Angela drafted me into the party planning committee Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster Which to me seems excessive
27,2,10,Michael,  Merry Christmas Ho ho ho  pimp Im kidding What do we got what do we got How many plates are we getting
28,2,10,Angela, Fifty
29,2,10,Michael, Double it Double everything Double ice cream Double napkins Double it On me
30,2,10,Michael, It was a tough year I had to fire somebody this year This party has to really rock Check it out Christmas bonus 3000 Gs I got this for helping save the company money So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all Maybe I should call him and tell him that
31,2,10,Michael, I want people to cut loose I want people making out in closets I want people hanging from the ceilings lamp shades on the heads I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party And also I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera And Ill be taking pictures all along the way And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter Incentive

108,2,10,Jim, What is Yankee Swap
109,2,10,Michael, One person chooses a gift The next person can either choose a gift or steal that persons gift If your gift gets stolen then you can steal somebody elses gift or choose a new gift

111,2,10,Pam, Yeah we call it White Elephant
112,2,10,Michael, Well I call it fun
113,2,10,Oscar, Why are we doing this

115,2,10,Angela, It sounds mean
116,2,10,Michael, Shut it No its not Okay just give it a shot

118,2,10,Michael, Okay Meredith is up first Heres the deal You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody elses gift that theyve already gotten like the oven mitt
119,2,10,Meredith, Ill take the teapot

142,2,10,Meredith, Ill take the oven mitt
143,2,10,Michael, Sucker See I wanted somebody to take it Boom Reverse psychology
144,2,10,Michael, Reverse psychology is an awesome tool I dont know if you guys know about it but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid Works like a charm
145,2,10,Michael,  In addition to these paintball pellets your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute
146,2,10,Dwight, You and me Michael Yes
147,2,10,Michael, Who wants to take paintball lessons How is that better than an iPod
148,2,10,Dwight, I never said it was better than an iPod
149,2,10,Dwight, Michael keeps bragging about his iPod but you know what Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily like 2 grand

151,2,10,Michael, Last gift Kevin
152,2,10,Kevin, I want the foot bath
153,2,10,Kevin, Thats the thing I bought myself Im really psyched to use it  Maybe I should have taken the iPod Oh sht

163,2,10,Dwight, Yes There you go I want the teapot Gracias
164,2,10,Jim, Got to be kidding me
165,2,10,Dwight, Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets  Christmas
166,2,10,Michael,  What is she so upset about
167,2,10,Pam, Maybe because you hated her present so much
168,2,10,Michael, Come on I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit I think its a success and Im the one who ended up with Dwights stupid paintball pellets
169,2,10,Jim, Yeah but Michael the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people
170,2,10,Stanley, And you should have just bought a 20 gift like everyone else
171,2,10,Michael, Well I didnt I got a big bonus because I fired Devon and I used the money to buy something awesome Sue me
172,2,10,Oscar, You got a bonus check

178,2,10,Michael, All right now youre the expert Is this enough to get 20 people plastered
179,2,10,Liquor Store Clerk, Fifteen bottles of vodka Yeah that should do it
180,2,10,Michael, Cool cool Box it up
181,2,10,Jim, I bought this teapot for Pam and I know she really wants it So can I trade you for it
182,2,10,Dwight, No trades

187,2,10,Jim, You dont even drink tea
188,2,10,Dwight, True But I get sinus infections and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems 
189,2,10,JIm, Okay 
190,2,10,Dwight,  and pouring it directly into your nose like so 
191,2,10,Jim, To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that its a little too much to handle

74,2,13,Michael, Really
75,2,13,Jim, Umm hmm
76,2,13,Michael, Who else knows
77,2,13,Jim, Nobody
78,2,13,Michael, Wow
79,2,13,Michael, Jim and I are great friends We hang out a ton mostly at work But the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship And it is why I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can

104,2,13,Dwight, There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying The liar will avoid direct eye contact The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands especially the mouth The liar will perspire Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful
105,2,13,Michael, Its Grrrrrrape Soda
106,2,13,Jim, Tony the tiger You dont hear that much any more
107,2,13,Michael, Not so much

111,2,13,Michael, Jim and I talk all the time We tell each other secrets
112,2,13,Dwight, Ok So what is the secret Michael
113,2,13,Jim, Um I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material
114,2,13,Dwight, Is that true
115,2,13,Michael, Um I dont know yeah yeah yeah it is
116,2,13,Dwight, Thank you Michael I know your telling the truth
117,2,13,Michael, Ok

93,2,14,Michael, When I was in training many years ago not so long ago I worked sidebyside with a fellow named Todd Packer and together we rocked the office  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off and when people noticed we convinced them that they were crazy

122,2,15,Phyllis, Shes real good
123,2,15,Pam, Thanks
124,2,15,Jan, You know the company is offering a design training program in New York

126,2,15,Jan, Well its only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York but Im sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out
127,2,15,Pam, Well its just that the weekends arent good because um
128,2,15,Jan, There are always a million reasons not to do something
129,2,15,Michael, Lets start with the Warehouse What bothers you as guys you know
130,2,15,Darryl, My priority is safety
131,2,15,Michael, OK
132,2,15,Darryl, So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift playing with it like a toy It kind of gets under my skin
133,2,15,Michael, OK Yeah Yeah Yeah shhh
134,2,15,Darryl, Uh uh uh Dont shush me
135,2,15,Michael, I That was just
136,2,15,Darryl, That bothers me too

144,2,15,Jan, Dress for the job you want not the job you have All right You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be
145,2,15,Angela, Im not gaining anything from this seminar Im a professional woman The head of accounting Im in the healthiest relationship of my life I just think its insulting that Jan thinks we need this And apparently judging from her outfit Jan aspires to be a whore
146,2,15,Roy, I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then theyre like When are we going to go on a datedate
147,2,15,Guy, I hate that too 
148,2,15,Darryl, I hate that too

158,2,15,Darryl, We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
159,2,15,Michael, Ah you do So
160,2,15,Darryl, But we get paid a lot less
161,2,15,Dwight, Word
162,2,15,Roy, Like next to no benefits
163,2,15,Michael, I know God What is that
164,2,15,Roy, Exactly
165,2,15,Michael, It blows It blows man Gah
166,2,15,Darryl, You know this would not happen if we had a union
167,2,15,Roy, Thats what Im talking about
168,2,15,Michael, No Whoa whoa Yeah
169,2,15,Roy, Absolutely
170,2,15,Darryl, Thats what we need
171,2,15,Guy, You know youre right
172,2,15,Darryl, Man see Thats what Ive been sayin man We need to do this finally
173,2,15,Michael, You know what Is that necessary Because you already sorta have a union of guys
174,2,15,Darryl, Its more than necessary Mike We need this Roy You still have that card from the Dockworkers Union
175,2,15,Roy, In my truck
176,2,15,Michael, Dockworkers
177,2,15,Darryl, Man hook you up

182,2,15,Michael, The problem is the chicks And you gotta blame them
183,2,15,Darryl, Are you with us Mike
184,2,15,Michael, Yeahes
185,2,15,Darryl, Welcome to the warehouse
186,2,15,Group chant, Michael Michael Michael Mi
187,2,15,Jan, Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women Im sure that all of you have felt that before
188,2,15,Michael,  This is important Ladies take a breather Jan I uh wanna Can I help you Um I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union And they have some good points
189,2,15,Jan, What A union What
190,2,15,Michael, Dont get hysterical
191,2,15,Jan, Im not
192,2,15,Michael, Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women
193,2,15,Michael, Lets be rational here What are the pros What are the cons
194,2,15,Jan, The cons are that everyone will lose their job Michael Everyone Office Warehouse What do you think the pros are here
195,2,15,Michael, Dont talk to me that way please Just theyre going to want to hear this from you
196,2,15,Jan, You got yourself into this Michael so you get yourself out
197,2,15,Michael, But were bonding down there

209,2,15,Michael, Im just saying we have something Ok Whatever
210,2,15,Ryan, You know what we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line
211,2,15,Stanley, This here is a runouttheclock situation Just like upstairs
212,2,15,Jan, Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office Now I know this might sound silly but a  many women ask to go over it So Fumble means
213,2,15,Phyllis, Mistake
214,2,15,Meredith, Slip
215,2,15,Jan, Right Par for the course is a golf term It means right on track Below par means worse Wait that should mean better that doesnt make sense
216,2,15,Kelly, What about second base Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you Does that mean you like closed a deal
217,2,15,Jan, Excuse me
218,2,15,Kelly, I mean thats a baseball term right
219,2,15,Jan, I dont know what Michael was talking about I dont know

235,2,15,Pam, Um
236,2,15,Jim, I think you should do it Thats great
237,2,15,Pam, Its really cool
238,2,15,Michael, Cold front coming into the Warehouse Uh oh Better put on your ski boots Woohoohoowoo Waaaah Happy New Year Darryl HeyDarryl You ever done this
239,2,15,Angela, Are you married
240,2,15,Jan, Im divorced
241,2,15,Phyllis, That must have been hard
242,2,15,Jan, It was Yes
243,2,15,Kelly, You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and thats why you did that thing with Michael
244,2,15,Jan, I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff
245,2,15,Phyllis, Mmmm I think were all okay with the balance weve struck
246,2,15,Angela, At least you dont have kids You have no kids right Thank God
247,2,15,Jan, Okay Lets take five I think we can all use five
248,2,15,Kelly, How can someone so beautiful be so sad
249,2,15,Michael, Hi
250,2,15,Jan, Did you take care of the situation
251,2,15,Michael, Yuh yuh yes I I have essentially
252,2,15,Jan, Excuse me
253,2,15,Michael, I have essentially Yes Ive taken some
254,2,15,Jan, Excuse me Ive been told theres been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it Obviously hes not a friend of yours because he didnt tell you the facts So let me If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that  They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message If you have any further questions you can direct them to to Michael
255,2,15,Pam, Dreams are just that Theyre dreams They help get you through the day Like the thing about the terrace Its nice but um I dont know It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that Just always kind of stuck with me
256,2,15,Jim, So youre not doing it
257,2,15,Pam, How did you know
258,2,15,Jim, Why not
259,2,15,Pam, Just like no big reason Just a bunch of little reasons
260,2,15,Jim, Come on
261,2,15,Pam, Roys right Theres no guarantee its going to lead to anything anyway
262,2,15,Jim, Roy said that
263,2,15,Pam, What You have something you want to say
264,2,15,Jim, You got to take a chance on something sometime Pam I mean do you want to be a receptionist here always
265,2,15,Pam, Oh excuse me Im fine with my choices
266,2,15,Jim, You are
267,2,15,Pam, Yeah
268,2,15,Pam, Its impractical Im not going to try to get a house like that Um they dont even make houses like that in Scranton So Im never going to 
269,2,15,Michael, Im just going to put this over there
270,2,15,Darryl, This is not a good idea right here
271,2,15,Michael, You did uh okay
272,2,15,Michael, Pizza Great equalizer Rich people love pizza Poor people love pizza White people love pizza Black people love pizza Do black people like pizza
273,2,15,Michael, Hey Um look guys Im sorry Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch
274,2,15,All the Men, Generalized mumbling agreement Yeah

278,2,15,Michael, Ahhh Excellent
279,2,15,Michael, Is it good to be back Yeah I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women You know why Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting

86,2,16,Dwight,  Exactly
87,2,16,Pam, Ok well sometimes the gift is really about the gesture you know like what it means instead of what it is
88,2,16,Dwight, You mean like a ham

130,2,16,Michael, Yeah I shot a bunch of footage around the office edited it together on my Mac I was thinking of entering it into some festivals Probably wont You know not what this is about
131,2,16,Michael,  And finally Pam Beesly Look at her Look how cute Not bad at all As the receptionist Pam is truly the gateway to our world Well I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton What its like to walk a mile in Oscars shoes Or try on Phyllis pants Maybe even one of Angelas famous brownies And youll know that youre home

152,2,16,Jan, Um Im sorry what did you think financial presentation meant
153,2,16,Craig, I was under the impression this was more of like a meet and greet type deal
154,2,16,David, So does that mean you dont have the numbers on your branch
155,2,16,Craig, That is correct yes
156,2,16,Jan, Craig you realize that were trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken
157,2,16,Craig, Look Im sorry I didnt know
158,2,16,Jan, Well the point is is that doesnt exactly bode well for your branch
159,2,16,Craig, Oh man you know what Michael made that stupid movie he doesnt get into any trouble Maybe I should have slept with you too 
160,2,16,Michael, Oh ok Alright
161,2,16,Jan, NO NO Im not Im not I just I just dont know what to do anymore Michael I mean were all gonna get fired
162,2,16,Michael, No youre not
163,2,16,Jan, Yeah Michael  the CFO thinks that we slept together Do you understand people get fired for much less And I just  cant believe that you told everybody and we didnt even sleep together
164,2,16,Michael, Technically we fell asleep in the same bed So
165,2,16,Jan, Oh God Michael It was months ago It was once Its over Do you understand
166,2,16,Michael, Yes Im sorry I will fix this Ill talk to him Ill talk to David

21,2,17,Jim, What did I do to deserve this
22,2,17,Pam, Are you sad that Dwight beat you
23,2,17,Jim, No

37,2,17,Dwight, What if I give a really long extended Thank You For instance Thank you Mr Blank Thank you very very very

39,2,17,Dwight, When I was in the sixth grade I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee It was me against Raj Patel And I misspelled in front of the entire school the word failure
40,2,17,Dwight, I cant do this
41,2,17,Michael, Thats because youre incapable of doing it because you dont know how Because you have no skills Dwight theres no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time
42,2,17,Dwight, Oh okay
43,2,17,Michael, But I can teach you enough so that you dont embarrass me or the company
44,2,17,Dwight, Okay deal Ill do whatever you say No questions asked

46,2,17,Dwight, Ill try and think of one When
47,2,17,Michael, Dont Dont try and think of a question to humor me Just try not to be such an idiot

120,2,17,Michael, Confidence Dwight
121,2,17,Jim, Dwight If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go

125,2,17,Jim, You know I majored in Public Speaking in College
126,2,17,Dwight, You did
127,2,17,Jim, Mmmhmm And the first thing they teach you is that youve got to be true to your self And you are all about authority
128,2,17,Dwight, Yes I am
129,2,17,Jim, The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers They were people of passion So if you want to do well today you got to do what they did
130,2,17,Dwight, Which is
131,2,17,Jim, Youve got to wave your arms and youve got to pound your fists Many times Its supposed to emphasize your point
132,2,17,Jim, Ok I didnt actually major in Public Speaking But I did download speeches from some of historys famous dictators Like this one  Originally given by Benito Mussolini
133,2,17,Jim, Ok look I know you are giving this speech on your own but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at I hope you dont mind
134,2,17,Dwight, Ill glance at it
135,2,17,Michael, Its time Dwight The grim reaper is here

155,2,17,Kevin, I always set it at 69 
156,2,17,Pam, Maybe well use a DJ Thats the one thing Roys in charge of for this wedding but all hes managed to do is set a date

180,2,17,Crowd, 
181,2,17,Dwight, Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word Theyll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans This is our duty  to change their perception I say salesmen and women of the world unite We must never acquiesce for it is together TOGETHER THAT WE PREVAIL We must never cede control of the motherland For it is
182,2,17,Crowd,  Together that we prevail

219,2,18,Toby, Uh its true
220,2,18,Michael, Well sure playing the field is great dont get me wrong but theres more to life than notches just on my bedpost
221,2,18,Toby, Mmhmm
222,2,18,Michael, Tell me something honestly do you think that it is too late for me to have kids
223,2,18,Toby, Well you need a wife first or at least a girlfriend
224,2,18,Michael, What about
225,2,18,Toby, Not Jan
226,2,18,Michael, Jan Kay
227,2,18,Toby, If you really want to have kids I I guess you could somehow foster parent or something

245,2,18,Jake, Thats so awesome
246,2,18,Pam, I know
247,2,18,Michael, Yes it is true I Michael Scott am signing up with an online dating service Thousands of people have done it and I am going to do it I need a username And I have a great one  Little kid lover That way people will know exactly where my priorities are at
248,2,18,Kevin, Go ahead
249,2,18,Abby, Do you want to come over for dinner tonight
250,2,18,Jim, Ohh man I would love to I cant tonight but can I come over some other time 
251,2,18,Kevin, Whatre you doing You never have plans
252,2,18,Jim, Thanks Kev Uhm Im actually going on a date
253,2,18,Kevin, Niiice
254,2,18,Michael, Hey uh no please You cant leave yet Theres still one more thing we need to do
255,2,18,Michael,  You who are on the road must have a code that you can live by  and so become yourself because the past is just a goodbye and teach your children well
256,2,18,Jim, Why does he own a guitar if he doesnt know how to play
257,2,18,Pam, I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer 
258,2,18,Michael and Dwight,  did slowly go by and feed them on your dreams
259,2,18,Pam, My theory is that 
260,2,18,Michael and Dwight,  The one they picked the one youll know by dont you ever ask them why if I told you would cry you never look at them and sigh and know they love you
261,2,18,Dwight, And they do your parents love you very much
262,2,18,Michael, One more time  You
263,2,18,Dwight, The Schrutes consider children very valuable In the olden days the women would bear many children so we would have enough laborers to work the fields And if it was an especially cold winter and there werent enough grains or vegetables they would eat the weakest of the brood  They didnt eat the children
0,2,19,Michael, So Phil recruited me to sell these cards and now I am recruiting you
1,2,19,Oscar, Who is this guy again
2,2,19,Michael, Dont worry about Phil He drives a corvette He is doing just fine Okay Calling cards are the wave of the future These things sell themselves
3,2,19,Ryan, Who uses calling cards anymore
4,2,19,Michael, You know what Thats a nice attitude Ryan Im just helping you invest in your future my friend
5,2,19,Oscar, This sounds like a get rich quick scheme
6,2,19,Michael, Yes Thank you You will get rich quick We all will
7,2,19,Toby, Didnt you lose a lot of money on that other investment the one from the email
8,2,19,Michael, You know what Toby When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly asking for help you help His father ran the freaking country okay Alright so raise your hand if you wanna get rich  Alright
9,2,19,Jim, No um How is this not a pyramid scheme
10,2,19,Michael, Alright let me explain Again  Phil has recruited me and another guy Now we are getting three people each The more people that get involved the more who are investing the more money were all going to make Its not a pyramid scheme it is a its not even a scheme per se its   I have to go make a call

2,2,20,Dwight, Thanks girl
3,2,20,Jim, So yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot Which is unfortunate because as it turns out Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs
4,2,20,Dwight, slow moving inattentive dull constantly snacking shows a lack of motivation
5,2,20,Kevin,  Hey
6,2,20,Dwight, I like the people I work with generally with four exceptions But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriffs deputy to make friends And by the way I havent
7,2,20,Jim,  I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip
8,2,20,Pam,  Jim does the best impressions Sometimes hell look up at me from his desk and hell just be someone else Like hell go um  thats supposed to be Phyllis I cant do it as good as he can
9,2,20,Kelly, And the guys are saying chug chug chug but Im so small and all Id eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said Is it okay if I sip it and they said no but Ryan seemed cool either way
10,2,20,Dwight, Stop This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour Illegal drugs were consumed on company property okay Your ass is on the line mister My ass is is on the line Now Im going to ask you again What time did you go home last night

16,2,20,Dwight, Dont make me do this the hard way
17,2,20,Ryan, Whats the hard way
18,2,20,Dwight, I go down to the police station on my lunch break I tell a police officer I know several what I suspect you may have in your car He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant once he has said warrant he will drive over here and make you give him the keys to your car and you will have to obey him
19,2,20,Ryan, Yeah lets do it that way
20,2,20,Michael, Ry is he bugging you Dwight dude you gotta take a chill pill man It was one joint in the parking lot You know youre totally harshing the office mellow

32,2,20,Dwight, Well you have
33,2,20,Michael, Uuf well
34,2,20,Dwight, because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have

41,2,20,Dwight, Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his greatgrandmothers funeral What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer Hes a potential drug mule
42,2,20,Dwight, Have you ever taken any illegal drugs
43,2,20,Oscar, No I have not
44,2,20,Dwight, Do you think its possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it
45,2,20,Oscar, What are you implying
46,2,20,Dwight, Have you ever pooped a balloon
47,2,20,Oscar, Okay Im done with this
48,2,20,Dwight, He sure left in a hurry
49,2,20,Dwight, I dont want to blow this This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of The chance to solve an actual crime
50,2,20,Dwight, Do you know what this is 
51,2,20,Phyllis, Yes its marijuana
52,2,20,Dwight, How do you know that
53,2,20,Phyllis, Its labeled
54,2,20,Dwight,  Dammit
55,2,20,Creed, That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica
56,2,20,Dwight, No its marijuana
57,2,20,Jim, Im just saying that you cant be sure that is wasnt you
58,2,20,Dwight, Thats ridiculous of course it wasnt me
59,2,20,Jim, Marijuana is a memory loss drug so maybe you just dont remember
60,2,20,Dwight, I would remember
61,2,20,Jim, Well how could you if it just erased your memory
62,2,20,Dwight, Thats not how it works
63,2,20,Jim, Now how do you know how it works
64,2,20,Dwight, Knock it off okay Im interviewing you
65,2,20,Jim, No You said that Id be conducting the interview when I walked in here Now exactly how much pot did you smoke
66,2,20,Dwight, 
67,2,20,Oscar, So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression Id love to hear it
68,2,20,Jim, Oh um Why do you keep CCing me on things that have nothing to do with me 
69,2,20,Stanley, Is that supposed to be me
70,2,20,Jim, Oh hey Stanley Uh I was just doing an impression
71,2,20,Stanley, I do not think that is funny
72,2,20,Pam, He does everyone in the office
73,2,20,Stanley, Hmmmpt
74,2,20,Pam/Jim,  I do not think that is funny
75,2,20,Pam, Jinx Buy me a coke
76,2,20,Jim, Oh
77,2,20,Pam, No no no no talking Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke Those are the rules of jinx and they are unflinchingly rigid 
78,2,20,Pam, Sold out That has never happened in the history of jinx
79,2,20,Jim,  Cmon
80,2,20,Pam, Sorry thats not my problem
81,2,20,Jim, 
82,2,20,Dwight, I know youre innocent but I cant look like Im treating you any differently
83,2,20,Angela, I understand
84,2,20,Dwight, Where were you yesterday after work
85,2,20,Angela, 
86,2,20,Michael, Uhoh Uhoh Whos he calling Ratting somebody out Narc Narc Kevin

88,2,20,Michael, Remember the narc bit  Uhoh whos in trouble
89,2,20,Dwight, Attention everyone Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyones urine
90,2,20,Michael, Waa what What are you talking about
91,2,20,Dwight, Company policy If drugs are found on the premises there is atmatic drug testing conducted within twentyfour hours
92,2,20,Oscar, Is that true Toby
93,2,20,Toby, Oh when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing
94,2,20,Michael, Two nights ago I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center I scored these great aisle seats Anyway after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one I dont know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes and Im sure that it was clove cigarettes Everybody in the aisle was doing it
95,2,20,Michael, Okay attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled Instead I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection
96,2,20,Dwight, No you cant do that
97,2,20,Michael, I can do that it is my office
98,2,20,Dwight, No you cannot It has to be official and it has to be urine
99,2,20,Michael, Hmmm Ha  Alright Great
100,2,20,Dwight, Kevin what prescription drugs are you taking besides Rogaine
101,2,20,Kevin, Im not taking Rogaine
102,2,20,Dwight, Angela what about you
103,2,20,Angela, I dont take any prescription drugs
104,2,20,Dwight, Youre not on anything
105,2,20,Angela, 
106,2,20,Dwight, Good
107,2,20,Kelly, So the first time we went out to dinner it was like whatever fine but I was so nervous So this time I wanted to be special so I bought a new dress  One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something but not everything  I mean not everything Jim  I promise Im not that kind of
108,2,20,Pam, Hey guys whats going on
109,2,20,Kelly, Were having the best conversation 
110,2,20,Pam, Oh okay Well Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room  But you know what We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation 
111,2,20,Kelly, So I was looking so hot
112,2,20,Michael, It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about
113,2,20,Phyllis, We dont feel that way
114,2,20,Angela, No not at all
115,2,20,Oscar, You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc
116,2,20,Michael, No uh no That was a test I was testing you and you all failed Miserably When I said that Dwight was a narc how many of you defended him How many of you said Hey you know what hes right What hes doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs
117,2,20,Dwight, Thank you Michael
118,2,20,Michael, I am ridiculously antidrug So antidrug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion or testing of any kind
119,2,20,Michael, Drugs ruin lives people Drugs destroy careers Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny but just imagine how funny they would be if they didnt smoke pot I want everybody to take a look to their left Now I want everybody to take a look to their right One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives This year more people will use coca1ne than will read a book to their children
120,2,20,Stanley, Where did you get these facts
121,2,20,Michael, Are these facts scaring you or are they not
122,2,20,Stanley, They are not
123,2,20,Michael, Do you think that smoking drugs is cool Do you think that doing alcohol is cool
124,2,20,Stanley, No I dont I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week For the antioxidants
125,2,20,Michael, Okay enough enough enough I have written down a list of illegal drugs Take a gander How many of these are you familiar with
126,2,20,Toby, Hookah is not an illegal drug Michael
127,2,20,Michael, Yes it is
128,2,20,Toby, No its not Its a type of pipe You can fill it with tobacco often mixed with fruit or other flavors
129,2,20,Michael, Okay you know what Toby Pam can you take this down  In addition to Tobys urine being tested I would like to test his blood and his hair
130,2,20,Toby, You cant do that
131,2,20,Michael, I can test anyone randomly and I have chosen you randomly
132,2,20,Toby, Thats not random
133,2,20,Michael, Okay eeny meenie miney moe is random Okay you know what Im going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives or the lives of a loved one Yeah Pam
134,2,20,Pam, I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs
135,2,20,Michael, Really 
136,2,20,Pam, Uh hmmm
137,2,20,Michael, Jim its okay You can t  This would be a good place to let it out Jim These are people you can trust These are people who care about you  Its okay just we will not judge you We are here to not judge you  Oh hes doing it okay  Its okay  Oh Okay are you sure  That looked like it was going to be good Alright  Okay well
138,2,20,Pam, Wow He really pulled out the big gns Fake crying Did not expect that
139,2,20,Michael, The point Im trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs I hate them and based upon what I have seen you all dont quite hate em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test and I am not
140,2,20,Dwight, No you will be tested
141,2,20,Michael, Yes I will not be
142,2,20,Dwight, You will be That is the law according to the rules
143,2,20,Michael, Okay well Dwight just know that Ive been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasnt planning on going to the bathroom and I dont even know if anything is going to come out okay So good Thank you
144,2,20,Dwight, Hi Linda Dwight Schrute Assistant Regional Manager You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriffs deputy

162,2,20,Dwight, But thats illegal
163,2,20,Michael, Dont think of it that way Its like urine goes all over the place You know theres no controlling it It just goes
164,2,20,Dwight, Not my urine
165,2,20,Michael, A cup could find its way under the urine It might be an accident It happens
166,2,20,Dwight, Were you forced to do drugs at this concert
167,2,20,Michael, No just look Look Just just fill up the cup
168,2,20,Angela, Do you want to give Michael your urine

52,2,21,Michael, WinWin is number four and number five is winwinwin The important difference here is with winwinwin we all win Me too I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work
53,2,21,Michael,  Okay since this is the disputed poster Now one at a time I want you to express your feelings using I emotion language and no judging or you statements
54,2,21,Angela, I got this poster for Christmas and I feel I want to see it everyday It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists and God has a really cute sense of humor
55,2,21,Michael, Come on seriously that
56,2,21,Oscar, I dont like looking at it Its creepy and in bad taste and its just offensive to me It makes me think of the horrible frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it Its kitsch Its the opposite of art It destroys art It destroys souls This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno Im talking about the
57,2,21,Michael, Okay okay Stop stop stop Lets see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are winwin
58,2,21,Pam, Win
59,2,21,Michael, Yes Thank you Pam How about Angela makes the poster into a tshirt which Oscar wears That way he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar she can see it Winwinwin
60,2,21,Oscar, No
61,2,21,Angela, Thats no
62,2,21,Michael, Okay well brainstorm Own the solution
63,2,21,Angela, How about I leave it up
64,2,21,Oscar, How bout she takes it down
65,2,21,Pam, How about Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays
66,2,21,Michael, Okay that is called a compromise And it is style 3 And it is not ideal To sum up winwin  make the poster into a tshirt winlose  take the poster down compromise  Tuesdays and Thursdays And the answer is make the poster into a tshirt Winwin
67,2,21,Pam, Win
68,2,21,Oscar, Fine
69,2,21,Angela, But it
70,2,21,Michael,  It is done

77,2,21,Toby, You solved it
78,2,21,Michael, Yes
79,2,21,Toby, Well good We can uh throw that one out 
80,2,21,Michael, Are those all the other complains
81,2,21,Toby, MmmHm

83,2,21,Toby, I I cant do that
84,2,21,Michael, You cant do that huh Huh ok Now you and I have a conflict I order you to give me that file
85,2,21,Toby, That 
86,2,21,Michael, Okay  There No more conflict  I had to use winlose on that It was not pretty  All right is that it
87,2,21,Toby,  Its all Dwights
88,2,21,Toby, Every Friday at 4 I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim I tell him that Im sending them to a special file in New York That box is the special file in New York
89,2,21,Michael, Ohh God Alright Why do I have to do everything
90,2,21,Photographer, Are you sure 
91,2,21,Dwight, Oh hes sure Just sht
92,2,21,Photographer, 
93,2,21,Michael,  This is from Kevin He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright Creed huh Duh duh Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist
94,2,21,Pam, Nice
95,2,21,Michael, You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me
96,2,21,Toby, Actually I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael This is January through March of this year 
97,2,21,Michael, How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee  And did you get what you wanted or were you merely listened to you forget about your problem and you move on  That is outrageous I love this place and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering  Okay today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open where it can be resolved Alright how about the PhyllisAngela dispute
98,2,21,Angela, You already did me
99,2,21,Michael, Thats what she said  The thing is Angela you are in here an awful lot You have complained about everybody in the office except Dwight which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight Toby by the way what does redacted mean There is a file full of complaints in here marked redacted 
100,2,21,Toby, Yeah it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it so I took their name off
101,2,21,Michael, Oh ok There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago
102,2,21,Dwight, Whoa wha wait If someone has a problem with me why would they withdraw it six months ago
103,2,21,Pam,  Um lets move on I volunteer Did anyone have a problem with me
104,2,21,Michael, All right Pamela Come on down Lets do it And  okay Just one complaint Actually it has been withdrawn So that is no help to us Next
105,2,21,Pam, Wait what did it say
106,2,21,Michael, Uh Does she have to plan her wedding on office time Couldnt she do that at home  Who else Why dont we just warm up first Warm up emotionally all right
107,2,21,Pam, I have this kind of big secret about Angela And Ive been really nice to her and I havent told anyone And what the hell
108,2,21,Michael, Ryan never returns my calls Ugh join the club
109,2,21,Ryan, My voicemails really spotty sometimes
110,2,21,Kelly, I didnt file a complaint I was just talking
111,2,21,Toby, To your HR representative
112,2,21,Kelly, To my friend I thought I want that withdrawn
113,2,21,Toby, Fine Ill take your name off  So no one will know
114,2,21,Michael,  Makin progress  Yes
115,2,21,Jim, Dwight tried to kiss me
116,2,21,Michael, What
117,2,21,Jim, And I didnt tell anyone because Im not really sure how I feel about it
118,2,21,Dwight, That is not true Redact it Redact it
119,2,21,Jim, Well Im not actually making a formal complaint I just really think we should talk about it
120,2,21,Dwight, Okay question  When a name is withdrawn does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York
121,2,21,Toby, Sure
122,2,21,Michael, Stanley 
123,2,21,Pam,  Hey Thanks for ratting me out
124,2,21,Michael,  You got a lot of anger under there buddy Come on start us out Unleash it
125,2,21,Anglea, I didnt do it 
126,2,21,Pam, I find that hard to believe considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe
127,2,21,Michael, Someone complained that the mens room is whites only Stanley you know thats not true
128,2,21,Stanley, I didnt say that
129,2,21,Creed, Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door 
130,2,21,Michael, Okay Phyllis You complained that Angelas giving you dirty looks And you tried to get off the party planning committee
131,2,21,Phyllis, No I never said any such thing Angela and I are close
132,2,21,Michael, And also Phyllis Stanley says that you cry too much and that bugs him
133,2,21,Phyllis, Stanley and I are close too
134,2,21,Stanley, We sit close
135,2,21,Michael, Oh ok
136,2,21,Toby,  Just take it 
137,2,21,Pam, I cant believe Angela I went against my better judgment and I gave her a Save The Date And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby
138,2,21,Jim, Well it was redacted Look if she wants an invite maybe shes just trying to be friends
139,2,21,Pam, Dont take her side
140,2,21,Jim,  Well what does Roy think about everything
141,2,21,Pam, I dont know I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff
142,2,21,Jim, You mean your thoughts and feelings
143,2,21,Pam, Yeah
144,2,21,Jim, Yeah
145,2,21,Phyllis, I know you keep saying its your space even though theres no assigned parking but I keep forgetting
146,2,21,Angela, Yes thats the problem
147,2,21,Phyllis, I guess so
148,2,21,Michael, Okay well all settled then
149,2,21,Phyllis,  I dont like you
150,2,21,Michael, OK Ryan You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell
151,2,21,Creed, I know exactly what hes talking about I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer Very nutritious But they smell like death
152,2,21,Michael, Angela you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable
153,2,21,Kevin, I accept your decision
154,2,21,Jim, Hey you know what Dwight Maybe we should get our photo ID taken together
155,2,21,Dwight, That doesnt make any sense
156,2,21,Jim, Well it saves time you know Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning Walk in together Perfect
157,2,21,Photographer,  Smile
158,2,21,Dwight, No
159,2,21,Dwight, I never smile if I can help it Showing ones teeth is a submission signal in primates When someone smiles at me all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life
160,2,21,Jim, This came out really well  There you go
161,2,21,Dwight, This is humongous I am not a security threat
162,2,21,Jim, Oh

197,2,21,Michael, Okay so Dwight in your own words   Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons I suspect Jim Halpert  Everyone has called me Dwayne all day I think Jim Halpert paid them to
198,2,21,Jim,  Yes Five bucks each And it was totally worth it
199,2,21,Michael,  This morning I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed mrder I think he may be the real mrderr  Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the womans room When I went to save the child I saw Meredith on the can Gah This morning I knocked myself in the head with the phone
200,2,21,Jim, That actually took a while I had to put uh more and more nickels into his handset till he got used to the weight and then I just took em all out
201,2,21,Michael,  Every time I typed my name it said Diapers
202,2,21,Jim, Just a simple macro You know these actually dont sound that funny one after another But he does deserve it though
203,2,21,Michael, By the end of the day my desk was about two feet closer to the copier
204,2,21,Jim, Yeah I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom And thats how I spent my entire day that day
205,2,21,Michael, The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage where they dig into your body very hard And it is very painful And apparently some people throw up But the next day they feel great Ive never had one They sound awful

10,2,22,Jim, Yeah
11,2,22,Dwight, How would you do that
12,2,22,Jim, Mind control
13,2,22,Dwight,  You cant be serious Are you serious
14,2,22,Jim, Ever since I was a little kid like eight or nine I could sort of control things with my mind
15,2,22,Dwight, I dont believe you Continue
16,2,22,Jim, It was just little thing you know like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter You know just little things
17,2,22,Dwight,  Thats ridiculous You know what Uh Why dont you move that coat rack Excuse me everyone Attention in the office please Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence Go ahead
18,2,22,Jim, Okay Ill try  
19,2,22,Dwight, Oh my God
20,2,22,Michael, I try not to think of it as lagging behind Its more of a DavidandGoliath thing
21,2,22,Jan,  Yeah but Well the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee
22,2,22,Michael, Top 80 percent

28,2,22,Michael, Emeril Oh actually while I have you not that I have you or have ever had you but were having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here

30,2,22,Michael, I am but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez
31,2,22,Jan,  I think you can handle it
32,2,22,Michael, Oh come on Come on

37,2,22,Michael, Okay everybody Tonights event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America
38,2,22,Oscar, Again We do that every year
39,2,22,Michael, Well they need our money They dont have cookies like the Girl Scouts
40,2,22,Oscar, Itd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering
41,2,22,Michael, Well Oscar if you dont like it then you should concentrate on winning Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive 500 to donate to the charity of their choice And they will get a minifridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration
42,2,22,Dwight, Yes
43,2,22,Michael, So get your charities in to Pam I for example am playing for Comic Relief
44,2,22,Jim, That doesnt exist anymore
45,2,22,Michael, Comedy is very much alive as are homeless people
46,2,22,Pam, No they stopped making that show
47,2,22,Michael, Well then they need our money more than ever
48,2,22,Angela, You have to pick an approved nonprofit organization
49,2,22,Creed, Theres a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton Delicious pea soup on Thursdays Ill probably give the money to them
50,2,22,Kevin, Something with animals Or people
51,2,22,Kelly, Kobe Bryant has a foundation and he is so hot And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring I know he didnt do it Maybe he did it
52,2,22,Angela, We are giving money that has been gambled Why dont we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves and donate that money to charity
53,2,22,Michael, Oh and another fun thing We at the end of the night are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts Right Toby Were gonna
54,2,22,Toby, Actually I didnt think it was appropriate to invite children since its You know theres gambling and alcohol and its in our dangerous warehouse and its a school night And you know Hooters is catering You know is that enough Should I keep going
55,2,22,Michael, Why are you the way that you are Honestly every time I try to do something fun or exciting you make it not that way I hate so much about the things that you choose to be Okay you know what I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief since apparently it doesnt exist I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS
56,2,22,Jim, I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan
57,2,22,Michael, No I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS
58,2,22,Phyllis, Afghani

69,2,22,Michael, There are certain topics that are offlimits to comedians JFK AIDS the Holocaust The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke Its one of my dreams
70,2,22,Jim, What are you doing
71,2,22,Pam, Oh nothing
72,2,22,Jim, Till Death Do Us Rock
73,2,22,Pam, Theyre wedding bands
74,2,22,Jim, Oh
75,2,22,Pam, Roy was supposed to pick the band but hes concentrating more on the bachelor party now
76,2,22,Jim, Wait wait where you going I mean even if you dont hire a band you still have to watch the bands Pam these are people who have never given up on their dreams I have great respect for that And yes theyre all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams
77,2,22,Pam, Theres a KISS cover band in here
78,2,22,Jim, Lets do it
79,2,22,Pam, Im pretty happy these days Im getting married soon and Im getting along with everybody at work

2,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 1 ],
3,2,9,Michael, TMI Too much information I used to say Dont go there but that is so lame now Or You go girl Or Um when did Wheres the beef That was like a long long time ago Its funny how the shelf life of these things like how long they last like Too much information probably came on the scene I mean I didnt hear it till like this month so its pretty recently Um but you know theyre generally good for like no more than five or six years
4,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 2 ],
5,2,9,Toby, Yes thats true I have never won a Dundie I am more than okay with that
6,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 3 ],
7,2,9,Kelly, I think Im gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby Toby is so cute except he has that stupid kid
8,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 4 ],
9,2,9,Angela, Yes Im the designated driver which is very important We need everyone to get home safely  But no one ever gives me gas money and people live all over Its expensive
10,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 5 ],
11,2,9,Dwight,  Like a gaggle of geese 
12,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 6 ],
13,2,9,Michael, All right we need something for Kevin
14,2,9,Jim, Mmmhmmm
15,2,9,Michael, What do we know about him Hes an accountant
16,2,9,Jim, He plays guitar he likes naval history Hes a bowler
17,2,9,Michael,  Hes fat The fat accountant award
18,2,9,Jim, Well you seem to have this under control
19,2,9,Jim, The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational I mean he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year Which is probably why this branch will be downsized
20,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 7 ],
21,2,9,Michael, I am the fat accountant
22,2,9,Dwight, Michael I need to talk to you
23,2,9,Michael, Here he is
24,2,9,Dwight, I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies room wall
25,2,9,Michael, Really What did they say For a good time call Michael Scott
26,2,9,Jim, Good one
27,2,9,Dwight, Uh no no No I think something bad maybe
28,2,9,Michael, Why do you think that You just immediately go to that Dwight Why are you so negative Why
29,2,9,Dwight, Michael
30,2,9,Michael, I mean you just come in and youre just negative
31,2,9,Dwight, Michael
32,2,9,Michael, and you just walk negatively
33,2,9,Michael, Do you want me to find out what it says
34,2,9,Michael, Yes
35,2,9,Dwight, By any means necessary
36,2,9,Michael, What does that even mean What are you What are you talking about
37,2,9,Dwight, Its the ladies room
38,2,9,Michael, Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me But dont tell anybody that I have anything to do with it because if they ask me I will say that you are crazy
39,2,9,Michael, Thank you You wont regret this Michael
40,2,9,Jim, What award would you like to give Dwight
41,2,9,Michael, I hadnt planned on including him
42,2,9,Jim, Okay
43,2,9,Michael, Kevin
44,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 8 ],
45,2,9,Dwight, It hasnt always been easy being a whistleblower When I was in school the kids would call me a tattletale or a snitch or a worm So I really identify with those women from Enron I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me but they never wrote back I guess theyre all married
46,2,9,Dwight, Angela its simple Just tell me what the bathroom wall says
47,2,9,Angela, I dont talk about what goes on in the restroom
48,2,9,Dwight, Im not asking what you do in there I just want to know whats written about Michael
49,2,9,Angela, I dont says those kinds of things out loud Its inappropriate
50,2,9,Dwight, Okay Ill talk You nod if I get it right Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener
51,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 9 ],
52,2,9,Kevin, I think his characters are pretty funny Especially Ping
53,2,9,Michael, Well what should I do guys Seriously do you want me to just cancel the Dundies
54,2,9,Kelly, No we were just hoping you wouldnt do those characters like last time
55,2,9,Michael, Ping Everybody loves Ping Hes my most popular character
56,2,9,Oscar, I think many people find that character slightly racist
57,2,9,Michael, Really Well he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have who talks exactly like that so I think you should take it up with him instead of me
58,2,9,Oscar, Look Im just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits
59,2,9,Michael,  Well neither of you are Chinese so what Why do you care
60,2,9,[ 02x01 Deleted Scene 10 ],

78,2,9,Phyllis, He was looking at me in the ladies room
79,2,9,Dwight, Thats totally unfair I was just in the ladies room in order to spy
80,2,9,Michael, Dwight youve hit a new low here
81,2,9,Phyllis, Thats what I said He was spying in the ladies room
82,2,9,Dwight, What do you think Phyllis You think I followed you in there Like Oh good Phyllis is going to the bathroom so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down Im not even attracted to you
83,2,9,Michael, That is a good point

77,3,1,Toby, OK Michael are you aware that you ousted Oscar today
78,3,1,Michael, What What does that even
79,3,1,Jan, Coming out is a significant moment for a gay person and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it
80,3,1,Michael, Well gay pride right Gay pride parade Its not like gay shame festival

89,3,1,Jan, Michael your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now Do you understand
90,3,1,Michael, The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100000 years of being weirded out by gays
91,3,1,Oscar, Am I the first gay man you ever knew
92,3,1,Michael, Trick question Cause you cant always tell so how would I know Is that the right answer
93,3,1,Pam, Michael Dwights looking at gay Prngrphy on his computer
94,3,1,Dwight, Uh Michael knows Pam He asked me to do this just for him He has his own reasons
95,3,1,Michael,  Nothing wrong with this stuff At all This is fine You know what Gay prn straight prn its all goooooood I dont particularly get into this But uh you know what I totally see the merit And actually it is quite beautiful

98,3,1,Angela, Watching some of your friends
99,3,1,Michael,  All right everybody in the conference room I dont care if you are gay or straight or a lesbian or overweight JUST GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW
100,3,1,Michael, Did you know that gay used to mean happy When I was growing up it meant lame And now it means a man who makes love to other men
101,3,1,Michael, Were all homos Homosapiens Gays arent necessarily who you think they are people I mean anybody could be gay Businessmen Like antique dealers or hairdressers or accountants Oscar why dont you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here However you want to do it Go ahead Stand up Im doing this for you
102,3,1,Oscar, Yes Im gay And I didnt plan on sharing that part of my life with you today so whatever Can I sit down now
103,3,1,Creed, Im not offended by homosexuality In the sixties I made love to many many women often outdoors in the mud and the rain And it was possible a man slipped in and there would be no way of knowing
104,3,1,Michael, Who should be the judges and juries of our society
105,3,1,Angela, Judges and juries
106,3,1,Michael, Yes thats a good point She has a good point Because gay marriage currently is not legal under US law I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sx as much as they could You know Sounds pretty good right
107,3,1,Kevin, That sounds great
108,3,1,Dwight, I think all the other office gays should identify themselves or I will do it for them
109,3,1,Oscar, No one else in this office is gay
110,3,1,Dwight, What about Phyllis She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine
111,3,1,Phyllis, Im getting married to Bob Vance
112,3,1,Michael, Thats great Congratulations Phyllis That is great and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing  See Everybody has a chance
113,3,1,Michael, But still Phyllis in college Did you ever experiment with other women A lot of women do
114,3,1,Phyllis, No you knew me in high school Course we all thought you were gay in high school
115,3,1,Michael,  Right  And I take that as a compliment
116,3,1,Phyllis, Well with your ties and your matching socks and 
117,3,1,Michael, Well I just like to look good OK so 
118,3,1,Oscar, You sound pretty defensive Michael
119,3,1,Michael, No I am just coming out myself I am coming out hetero
120,3,1,Oscar, I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here
121,3,1,Michael, Gay good
122,3,1,Michael, Look if I was gay I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen I would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just I would be waving that rainbow flag
123,3,1,Oscar, I dont think I can work here any longer This has been the worst most backwards day of my life
124,3,1,Michael, You misunderstand OK You know what OK I uh Im gonna put my money where my mouth is You ready I am going to embrace Oscar You might want to watch this Angela because you cant catch anything Here we go We are going to make a statement You and I are going to make a statement together Oscar is my friend 
125,3,1,Oscar, I would rather not
126,3,1,Michael, and I just dont care who sees it doesnt bother me
127,3,1,Oscar, No NO I dont want to touch you ever consider that Youre ignorant and insulting and small
128,3,1,Michael, All right um sorry
129,3,1,Oscar, Michael Im sorry That was a good idea Come on come on 
130,3,1,Michael,  Im sorry I called you fggie Youre not fggie Youre a a good guy
131,3,1,Dwight, Michael appears to be gay too And yet he is my friend I guess I do have a gay friend
132,3,1,Michael, You know what Im going to raise the stakes I want you to watch this And I want you to burn this into your brains Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this  I did it See Im still here Were all still here 
133,3,1,Michael,  Oh come on Dwight Come on man
134,3,1,Michael, We are not in the playground anymore There are new rules We have to be mature But we cant lose the spirit of child like wonder What is love anyway Maybe its supposed to break all the rules Like me and Jan Or Oscar and some guy Life is short When two people find each other what should stand in their way
135,3,1,Michael, I am glad that today spurred social change Thats part of my job as regional manager But you know what Even if it didnt at least we put this matter to bed thats what she said Or he said
136,3,1,Michael, Oh theres Gill Oscars roommate I wonder if he knows
137,3,1,Oscar, I was going to quit But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car All I had to do was sign something saying I wont sue Gill and I are going to Europe Kids sometimes it pays to be gay
138,3,1,Dwight,  Hope this helps Jim Nice

5,3,2,Pam, What was Oprah about
6,3,2,Michael, Angelina Jolie was on And she adopted a baby from Asia and she said that it changed her life And that really inspired me So I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost
7,3,2,Pam, Thats a really big decision
8,3,2,Michael, I know
9,3,2,Pam, Maybe you should wait before you adopt
10,3,2,Michael, Well
11,3,2,Pam, Or not adopt
12,3,2,Michael, Just do it okay
13,3,2,Pam, Roys sister looked into it and the application alone costs a thousand dollars
14,3,2,Michael, Um find out if theres a cheaper less expensive baby out there okay
15,3,2,Pam, You know she also said the waiting list is like eight months
16,3,2,Michael, Eight months
17,3,2,Pam, Yeah
18,3,2,Michael, I dont even know if Ill want a baby in eight months

57,3,4,Creed, Ed was decapitated
58,3,4,Michael, What
59,3,4,Dwight, Really
60,3,4,Creed, He was drunk as a skunk he was flying down Route 6 He slides under an 18 wheeler Pop It snaps right off
61,3,4,Michael, Oh my God
62,3,4,Dwight, That is the way to go Instant death Very smart
63,3,4,Creed, You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated
64,3,4,Dwight, Youre thinking of a chicken
65,3,4,Creed, What did I say
66,3,4,Michael, That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go Im sorry Alone out of the blue and not even have his own head to comfort him
67,3,4,Michael,  So Im not exactly sure how to say this
68,3,4,Dwight, Ed was decapitated
69,3,4,Michael, What are you doing
70,3,4,Dwight, You said you didnt know how to say it
71,3,4,Michael, I didnt he was driving on the road and he went under a truck And thats when his head was separated from the rest of him And I will let you know more as soon as I find out
72,3,4,Dwight, Hey
73,3,4,Angela, Hi
74,3,4,Dwight, If my head ever comes off I would like you to put it on ice
75,3,4,Angela, I do not wanna talk about this
76,3,4,Dwight, When I die I wanna be frozen And if they have to freeze me in pieces so be it I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in
77,3,4,Michael, I dont understand We have a day honoring Martin Luther King but he didnt even work here
78,3,4,Jan,  I understand how you feel Michael I really do So would it be helpful to give everyone the day off
79,3,4,Michael, You really dont get it do you You dont understand these people That is the last thing that they would want is a day off
80,3,4,Jan, Well what would you suggest
81,3,4,Michael,  A statue
82,3,4,Jan, Of Ed
83,3,4,Michael, Yeah
84,3,4,Jan,  Im not sure thats realistic
85,3,4,Michael, Well I think it would be very realistic it would look just like him
86,3,4,Jan, No thats not
87,3,4,Michael, We could have his eyes light up we could have his arms move
88,3,4,Dwight, That is not a statue that is a robot
89,3,4,Michael, I think that is a great way to honor Ed
90,3,4,Dwight, And how big do you want this robot
91,3,4,Michael, Lifesize
92,3,4,Dwight, Mm no Better make it twothirds Easier to stop if it turns on us
93,3,4,Jan, What the hell are you two talking about
94,3,4,Michael, Well we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company Jan
95,3,4,Jan, You know what Michael Ive really tried with you today
96,3,4,Michael, Mm hm
97,3,4,Jan, and I have to get back to work
98,3,4,Michael, Oh do you You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck
99,3,4,Jan, So call me when you feel like having a real conversation
100,3,4,Michael, But Ed truck cant because he is
101,3,4,Jan, Goodbye 
102,3,4,Michael, DEAD

118,3,4,Karen, Yeah nothing there
119,3,4,Andy, Did you check your butt

121,3,4,Phyllis, Okay thats enough
122,3,4,Michael, What
123,3,4,Stanley, We do not wanna hear about this
124,3,4,Michael, Well you know what I didnt wanna hear about it either Stanley but I did and now I cant stop picturing it He leaves work hes on his way home wham His cappa is detated from his head
125,3,4,Stanley, You have just spit on my face
126,3,4,Michael, Well you know what Theres something wrong with you There is something wrong with everybody in here Because we have lost a member of our family and you dont wanna talk about it you dont wanna think about it you just wanna get back to work
127,3,4,Michael, There are five stages to grief which are  denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance And right now out there theyre all denying the fact that theyre sad And thats hard And its making them all angry And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance And if not acceptance then just depression If I can get them depressed then Ill have done my job
128,3,4,Michael, I am going to throw you this ball When you catch the ball I want you to say the name of a person very important to you somebody really special who died and then I want you to say how they died and you may cry if you like that is encouraged Let me just start Let me show you how this works I catch the ball I lost Ed Truck And it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears and at the same time somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone and Im crying and nobody can hear me because I am terribly terribly terribly alone
129,3,4,Roy, Excuse me Im sorry to interrupt uh I need to see Pam There seems to be like something wrong with the radiator in her car
130,3,4,Michael, Okay fine Hurry back
131,3,4,Roy,  Theres nothing wrong with your car I just thought you might like a break from the grief counseling session
132,3,4,Pam, Oh I would like a break

151,3,4,Ryan,  Thanks Um a few years ago my family was on a safari in Africa and um my cousin Mufasa was um he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and um we all took it really hard All of us kind of in the audience of what happened
152,3,4,Michael, Do you want to talk about it anymore

201,3,4,Dwight, Im sorry I grew up on a farm We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum  It would have fit if he had given me another minute
202,3,4,Dwight, I need a box I need a box A small box not too confining
203,3,4,Pam, Is it for the bird
204,3,4,Dwight, Yeah
205,3,4,Pam, I have it covered 
206,3,4,Dwight, Oh thank you
207,3,4,Pam, If you wanna do something for the funeral
208,3,4,Dwight, Yes please
209,3,4,Pam, Maybe you could play a song on your recorder
210,3,4,Dwight, Excellent
211,3,4,Pam, Do you have it with you
212,3,4,Dwight, Always 
213,3,4,Pam, Did I wake up this morning thinking Id be throwing together a bird funeral You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into
214,3,4,Karen,  Whered you find them
215,3,4,Jim, Whered I find what
216,3,4,Jim, I called the manufacturer who referred me to distributor who referred me to the vending machine company who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door
217,3,4,Michael, Glad you could all make it
218,3,4,Kelly, You told us we had to
219,3,4,Michael, Dwight do you have the box
220,3,4,Pam, Actually I have it
221,3,4,Michael, You made this Wow  Thats thats very nice
222,3,4,Ryan, When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it And I remember thinking Im a little too old for this And I was five
223,3,4,Pam, Id also like to say a few words if thats okay
224,3,4,Michael, Yes
225,3,4,Pam, What do we know about this bird You might think Not much Its just a bird But we do know some things We know it was a local bird Maybe its that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above
226,3,4,Kevin, Oh I remember that That was SO funny
227,3,4,Pam, And we know how he died Flying into the glass doors But you know what I dont think he was being stupid I think he just really really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song
228,3,4,Dwight, Hes not a songbird
229,3,4,Michael, Shhh
230,3,4,Pam, An impression then Lastly we cant help but notice that he was by himself when he died but of course we all know that doesnt mean he was alone Because Im sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much He will not be forgotten
231,3,4,Angela,  Amen
232,3,4,Dwight, 
233,3,4,Pam,  Just smile for me and let the day begin You are the sunshine that lights my heart within on the wings of love 
234,3,4,Michael, Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong Well thats baloney because grief isnt wrong There is such a thing as good grief Just ask Charlie Brown
235,3,4,Dwight, Lets get back to work

60,3,7,Angela, What about us Michael Do we still have jobs
61,3,7,Michael, I dont know Probably not This is the worst

63,3,7,Angela, I dont want to blame anyone in particular I think everyones to blame
64,3,7,Kelly, If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off I will kll myself Like Romeo and Juliet the Claire Danes one
65,3,7,Andy,  Stamford Connecticut Stamford Connecticut
66,3,7,Jim, I worked in Scranton for a really long time And uh its going to be weird that its all disappearing I mean I always knew that the branch would shut down someday I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans
67,3,7,Stanley, I couldnt be happier Im gonna take the severance and retire My wife and I are gonna travel  I really couldnt be happier
68,3,7,Pam, Its a blessing in disguise Actually not even in disguise Sometimes at home I answer the phone DunderMifflin this is Pam So maybe thatll stop now
69,3,7,Roy, What does that mean
70,3,7,Kevin, Well some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut
71,3,7,Roy, I dont really want to work here without Pam You know that Cinderella song You Dont Know What You Got  That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it in words

16,3,9,Michael, Yeah Jan it um looks like a check piece of paper of some sort Receipt I dont know
17,3,9,Angela, Jan this is Angela Martin from accounting
18,3,9,Jan,  Mmhmm
19,3,9,Angela, Look we have a rebate from the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means
20,3,9,Jan, We get that money for hiring an exconvict
21,3,9,Michael, I didnt hire an exconvict Unless they mean Toby Convicted rpist   Im just kidding
22,3,9,Jan, When did the check come
23,3,9,Angela, Last week
24,3,9,Jan, Okay thats when the branches merged so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program Smart move
25,3,9,Angela, One of the Stamford people is a criminal

42,3,9,Kevin, Yeah
43,3,9,Jan, Michael
44,3,9,Michael, Why did the convict have to be a black guy It is such a stereotype I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice Like a white guy who went to prison for polluting a black guys lake
45,3,9,Kevin, I wonder what he did
46,3,9,Michael, In our society a black man can be arrested for almost anything He was probably at a sporting event and saw some people pushing each other and he intervened
47,3,9,Pam, Why would anyone go to jail for that
48,3,9,Michael, Sssssso what we need to do is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people
49,3,9,Kevin, Cool
50,3,9,Pam, Okay Angela
51,3,9,Angela, Sure Lets protect the convicts At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace As a 90pound female that sits in an illlit rarelyvisited corner of the office naturally I agree with that

173,3,9,Karen, DemenDementors like in Harry Potter
174,3,9,Michael, No not Harry Potter  There are no movies in prison This is my point You guys got it soft and cushy This place is freaking awesome The people are awesome Your boss is nice Everyone seems to get along People are tolerant People who have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves Nobody is nobodys bitch I hope that this scared you And from me Prison Mike to you I just wanna thank you for listening to me Letting me be a part of your life today Cause you got a good life YOu got a good life A good life  So What do you think It doesnt sound so great does it

186,3,9,Michael, Okay You know what Toby I am teaching them a lesson so

188,3,9,Michael,  Okay nutcases get out of there Good work Long day Really long Why dont you guys head home Early Time off for good behavior Heh Good job Enjoy your freedoms
189,3,9,Michael, Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford to a convict to my friend Back to a convict Then to a kind of a nuisance actually to be completely honest And finally to a quitter And I will not miss him And that is not because he is black
190,3,9,Andy,  So weve been told and some choose to believe it I know theyre wrong wait and see cause one day well find it the ainbowray onnectionkay the lovers the dreamers and meeee

99,3,11-Oct,Jim, What
100,3,11-Oct,Pam, For the past few months Ive been sending Dwight letters from the CIA 
101,3,11-Oct,Jim, Are you serious
102,3,11-Oct,Pam, Theyre considering him for a top secret mission Theres his application Oh and this is where I made him list every secret he promised hed never ever tell
103,3,11-Oct,Jim,  Last year my boss Michael Scott took a day off because he said he had pneumonia but really he was leaving early to go to magic camp Wow
104,3,11-Oct,Pam, So heres the gift You get to decide what his top secret mission is  Sorry I didnt wrap it
105,3,11-Oct,Jim,  You know what Uh I really dont think I should be doing this stuff anymore you know
106,3,11-Oct,Pam, Oh
107,3,11-Oct,Jim, No because of the promotion
108,3,11-Oct,Pam, Oh yeah
109,3,11-Oct,Jim, It just feels a little bit like
110,3,11-Oct,Pam, No I get it of course OK 
111,3,11-Oct,Jim, I feel like theres a chance for me to start over And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do then  what am I doing
112,3,11-Oct,Michael, Id like everybodys attention Christmas is canceled
113,3,11-Oct,Stanley, You cant cancel a holiday
114,3,11-Oct,Michael, Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Years

117,3,11-Oct,Pam, Michael whats going on
118,3,11-Oct,Michael, Carol and I split up Amicably And I just dont think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances
119,3,11-Oct,Jim, Will they still air Rudolph
120,3,11-Oct,Kevin, Thats not fair
121,3,11-Oct,Dwight,  Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well
122,3,11-Oct,Michael, Fine  Have your party Just no guests
123,3,11-Oct,Phyllis, But we invited guests
124,3,11-Oct,Michael, Well you know what Phyllis All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway leaving your life a stupid rotten mess
125,3,11-Oct,Michael, Oh oh oh oh it hurts
126,3,11-Oct,Pam, I know
127,3,11-Oct,Michael, It hurts my heart It hurts my stomach It hurts my arms
128,3,11-Oct,Pam, OK well why are you laying like that
129,3,11-Oct,Michael,  Thanks How did you push away the bad thoughts
130,3,11-Oct,Pam, Like what
131,3,11-Oct,Michael, Like maybe the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed that were foreign and scary
132,3,11-Oct,Pam, Well um I I dont
133,3,11-Oct,Michael, And not that you didnt want to try them Some wine may have helped Do you know what Im referring to
134,3,11-Oct,Pam, I dont need to know
135,3,11-Oct,Dwight, Michael Sorry to interrupt Uh It appears were one bathrobe short
136,3,11-Oct,Michael, Take it from Toby
137,3,11-Oct,Dwight, Copy
138,3,11-Oct,Michael, Hey would you like to go to Sandals Jamaica with me
139,3,11-Oct,Pam, No thank you
140,3,11-Oct,Michael, Its all  OK
141,3,11-Oct,Toby, Hey Dwight Pretty nice robe  Why
142,3,11-Oct,Angela, Phyllis I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch
143,3,11-Oct,Phyllis, I thought you said green was whorish
144,3,11-Oct,Angela, No orange is whorish
145,3,11-Oct,Karen, Uh so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home Each year we have a Christmas raffle  
146,3,11-Oct,Angela, It would never work here
147,3,11-Oct,Karen, Ok  um another idea was karaoke 
148,3,11-Oct,Angela, No
149,3,11-Oct,Karen, A Christmas drinking game 
150,3,11-Oct,Meredith, Yes
151,3,11-Oct,Angela, God help you
152,3,11-Oct,Karen, What
153,3,11-Oct,Angela, These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of A Nutcracker Christmas I think you should leave
154,3,11-Oct,Karen, Youre kidding
155,3,11-Oct,Angela, You tried this out and its clearly not for you Its time to go Come on  Please  Thank you OK thank you very much 
156,3,11-Oct,Michael, What are you doing 
157,3,11-Oct,Dwight,  We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol
158,3,11-Oct,Andy, Hey whats the haps 
159,3,11-Oct,Michael, Carol
160,3,11-Oct,Dwight, Oh look at this  Your old condo closing papers Its riddled with Carols name I wish I could throw this in the box 
161,3,11-Oct,Dwight, Why dont you just buy the whole song
162,3,11-Oct,Michael, I dont have to buy it I just want to taste it I just I just want a little taste of it
163,3,11-Oct,Dwight, Oh look at this she saved you two thousand dollars cause they failed to report a mold problem  But wouldnt that affect the final How did she Oh oh I see what she did That is good Wow Carol is one smart cookie
164,3,11-Oct,Michael,  Goodbye my lover Goodbye my friend 
165,3,11-Oct,Michael, This is an old adage but they say when you find true love you know within the first 24 hours With Carol I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her
166,3,11-Oct,Pam, I feel like Ive been kinda cold to Karen and theres no real reason for it I mean its not like shes ever done anything to me So I think I probably shouldnt be cold to her
167,3,11-Oct,Pam, Hey Karen Sorry about that meeting today that was really crazy
168,3,11-Oct,Karen, Yeah right Im so glad you said that Because I dont know how those meetings usually go
169,3,11-Oct,Pam, Um usually like that
170,3,11-Oct,Karen, Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or
171,3,11-Oct,Pam, I think one of her cats did once She came in with scratches all over her face 
172,3,11-Oct,Karen, Right
173,3,11-Oct,Pam, Um I really liked your karaoke idea
174,3,11-Oct,Karen, Oh cool yeah
175,3,11-Oct,Pam, That could really be fun
176,3,11-Oct,Karen, Oh thank you

192,3,11-Oct,Angela, No that is not a party Theres only one party and its hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three oclock
193,3,11-Oct,Kevin, Then why are there two flyers
194,3,11-Oct,Karen, Oh I understand that this is confusing for everyone let me explain Theres a party that starts at three

79,3,13,Andy, In order to take down Dwight I have to chip away at his ally which in this case is Michael Heres the good news Every success Ive ever had at my job or with the ladyfolk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down

98,3,13,Michael, Hawkman
99,3,13,Andy, My plan is taking longer than I thought but I dont give up easily I have walked two marathons
100,3,13,Michael,  Lets go The mens room was disgusting
101,3,13,Jim, After you sir
102,3,13,Dwight, No thank you I never let anyone walk behind me Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear
103,3,13,Jim, Ok well that still leaves a 30 chance that I will attack you from the front
104,3,13,Dwight, Uh yeah but it will be easier to stop I can always block the blow I can counter it with 
105,3,13,Pam, Angela you seem so happy I bet you wish you were like this all the time
106,3,13,Angela, This friend of mine  lets call her Noelle  she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York But then this gallant gentleman  well call him Kurt  he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her Thats I dont know I guess he really just likes her a lot
107,3,13,Pam, Thats great
108,3,13,Angela, Yes it is  Hello
109,3,13,Michael, Hey did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack
110,3,13,Buyer, Yep
111,3,13,Michael, You know I used to go up there all the time with my stepdad and I never caught anything that big
112,3,13,Andy, Caught an eightypound shark off of Montauk Its in the Hamptons My dads got a 42ft Bayliner Sniped it with a rfle from the crows nest Also shot a deer once
113,3,13,Michael, You know what Lets get right down to it DunderMifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse but what we lack in flash we will make up for with hardwork and decency
114,3,13,Andy, Ok this is the classic undersell because you should know we dont work out of a log cabin We trade on the New York Stock Exchange Ever heard of it Its in New York
115,3,13,Buyer, Uh I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company Weve had some problems in the past
116,3,13,Michael, I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company we will give you the care and attention of a small company
117,3,13,Andy, Oh man that is like poetry
118,3,13,Michael, No
119,3,13,Andy, I swear this guy could sell paper to a tree
120,3,13,Michael, Stop it  Stop it

127,3,13,Michael, Ah no Dont worry about it
128,3,13,Andy, I really Schruted it
129,3,13,Michael, What
130,3,13,Andy, Schruted it Its just this thing that people say around your office all the time Like when you screw something up in a really irreversible way you Schruted it I dont know where it comes from though Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute

49,3,16,Michael,  I hate you
50,3,16,Michael, Jeffs dog ended up as ring bearer And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said boo
51,3,16,Dwight, Why are all these people here There are too many people on this Earth We need a new plague Who are all these people
52,3,16,Jim, You know what I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers

46,3,17,Karen, Oh my God
47,3,17,Dwight, BAAAAT BAT NO EVERYONE REMAIN CALM There it goes
48,3,17,Stanley, Goooood bye
49,3,17,Angela,   Please dont let that stupid thing near me
50,3,17,Michael, Okay this is it Ryan is doing my intro right now
51,3,17,Ryan, DunderMifflin cant compete with the modern chains and management is unwilling or unable to adapt Their customers are dying off
52,3,17,Michael, I cant hear what hes saying but he looks like hes really into it
53,3,17,Dwight, We have a bat in the office
54,3,17,Toby, The simple solution would be to open a window if we had windows that could open
55,3,17,Angela, Poop is raining from the ceilings Poop
56,3,17,Jim, Okay Thanks  Animal control will be here at six
57,3,17,Dwight, At Six No that is unacceptable Okay Jim you are the number two in this office You need to step up and show some leadership
58,3,17,Jim, Im sorry what did you say So wierd
59,3,17,Dwight, What Whats so wierd
60,3,17,Jim, The bat I mean I know I felt it bite me but look Theres no mark I feel so tingly so strangely powerful  Oh well
61,3,17,Ryan, And now without further ado I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Michael Scott
62,3,17,Michael, Tourism Food service Railroads and sales And hospitals slash manufacturing And air travel
63,3,17,Dwight,  This is your job Halpert
64,3,17,Jim, Ow

67,3,17,Karen, But Jim this garlic bread is cold
68,3,17,Jim, What  No It burned me I bizarre
69,3,17,Dwight, No no One crisis at a time
70,3,17,Dwight, If a vampire bat was in the US it would make sense for it to come to a sylvania Like PENNsylvania Now that doesnt mean that Jim is going to become a vampire Only that he carries the vampiric germ
71,3,17,Michael, So you wanna start a business How do you start What do you need Well first of all you need a building And secondly you need supply You need something to sell Now this could be anything It could be a thingamajig Or a a whosiwhatsi Or  a Whatchamacallit  Now you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay  And if you sell enough of them you will make a 100 Grand   Satisfied
72,3,17,Toby, Oh this looks great Id Id love to be there but my daughters play is tonight  Damnit You know one of the other parents will probably videotape it
73,3,17,Pam, Oh No you should go
74,3,17,Toby, Well its important to support local art you know And what they do is not art
75,3,17,Michael, Okay Im seeing some confused faces out there Let me slow down a little bit Break this down Okay The more stickers you sell the more profit fancy word for money you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies
76,3,17,Ryan, Michael
77,3,17,Michael, And products
78,3,17,Ryan, What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing
79,3,17,Michael, Well okay I was just kind of getting it going Um alright Well okay we can do questions Okay Very good First hand up
80,3,17,Business Student #1, Sir as a company that primary distributes paper how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world
81,3,17,Michael, We cant overestimate the value of computers Yes they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails But real business is done on paper okay Write that down 
82,3,17,Karen, Hey Jim heres the aspirin you wanted
83,3,17,Jim, Oh thank God I have such a headache from that glare
84,3,17,Karen, What glare
85,3,17,Jim, The glare off Angelas crucifix Its blinding
86,3,17,Dwight, I dont have a lot of experience with vampires but I have hunted werewolves I shot one once But by the time I got to it it had turned back into my neighbors dog
87,3,17,Dwight, Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions We form an allegiance

92,3,17,Creed, What size
93,3,17,Business Student #2, What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain

102,3,17,Michael, Wait Ryan said that
103,3,17,Kelly, What are you doing Youd better not hurt that little bat
104,3,17,Creed, Animals cant feel pain
105,3,17,Kelly, Dont hurt that bat Creed Its a living thing with feelings and a family

113,3,17,Michael, Yeah yeah You know what else is facing five Goliaths America AlQaeda global warming sx predators mercury poisoning So do we just give up Is that what were learning in business school
114,3,17,Business Student #1, But in the big picture
115,3,17,Michael, DunderMifflin is the big picture Cant you understand that No you cant Youre too young Ryan has never made a sale And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita And everybody thinks hes a tease Well you know what He doesnt know anything and neither do you  SO SUCK ON THAT
116,3,17,Ryan, It wasnt personal
117,3,17,Michael, Business is always personal Its the most personal thing in the world When we get back to the office pack your things
118,3,17,Ryan, Pack my
119,3,17,Michael, You heard me pack your things

273,3,18,Jan, Please dont cry
274,3,18,Michael, Im not going to cry I feel like it but I am not going to Why dont you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces
275,3,18,Jan, It was never a love contract Michael and besides I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him

23,3,19,Dwight, Everyday for eight years I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees And everyday for eight years people have laughed at me Well whos laughing now 
24,3,19,Michael, No need for consternation everything is under control
25,3,19,Jan, Michael last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office
26,3,19,Michael, It was a crime of passion Jan not a disgruntled employee Everyone here is extremely gruntled
27,3,19,Jan,  Is Toby there
28,3,19,Michael, No
29,3,19,Toby, Im here Jan
30,3,19,Jan, Ok what what is the situation Toby
31,3,19,Toby, Well we fired Roy obviously And Jim wont press charges against Roy or the company
32,3,19,Jan, Thank God
33,3,19,Toby, Yeah um but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his
34,3,19,Michael, No he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and hes just using this Roy thing as leverage
35,3,19,Jan, All right well are you gonna take care of this

40,3,19,Michael, Yeesh
41,3,19,Pam, I really dont want to talk about it I dont mean to be rude but I just I dont want to comment on what happened It sucked
42,3,19,Jim, I guess all things considered I was lucky Dwight was there And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars
43,3,19,Jim, Hey man I never got a chance to thank you for stopping Roy Thank you
44,3,19,Dwight, Thank you not necessary and thus not accepted I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded
45,3,19,Jim, Okay Um Got you something
46,3,19,Dwight, Dont want it
47,3,19,Jim, You dont know what it is
48,3,19,Dwight, Dont want it Wont open it Dont need it Wont take it Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens
49,3,19,Jim, It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead That would have made us even I think He saves my life I get him a box for his desk toy Even Steven
50,3,19,Dwight, No dont call me a hero Do you know who the real heroes are The guys who wake up every morning and go into their normal jobs and get a distress call from the commissioner and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime Those are the real heroes
51,3,19,Oscar, Angela Roys check Hes coming in later to pick it up
52,3,19,Kevin, Man I cannot believe I missed the fight
53,3,19,Oscar, It was crazy

55,3,19,Oscar, Well I heard some shouting And I look over and Roys by reception and you could just tell hes gonna punch somebody Jim says something Roy stomps over there All of the sudden BAM Roy goes down and Dwights standing there like an action hero

89,3,19,Toby, Which is where
90,3,19,Dwight, Irrelevant Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrators eyes nose and face area Rendering him utterly and completely disabled Then I contacted the authorities The end

120,3,19,Michael, Hmm Ohh Darryl You are a good worker and a good man I just you know times are tight And I just dont think corporate is going to go for this right now
121,3,19,Darryl, Are you wearin lady clothes

130,3,19,Michael, All right
131,3,19,Darryl, This is too good
132,3,19,Michael, Alright you know what Pam could you please tell Darryl that this is not a womans suit
133,3,19,Pam, Oh my God thats a womans suit
134,3,19,Kevin, Youre wearing a womans suit
135,3,19,Michael, No I do I I wear mens suits OK I got this out of a bin
136,3,19,Michael, There were these huge bins of clothes and everybody was rifling through them like crazy and I grabbed one And it fit So I dont think that this is totally just a womans suit At the very least its bisexual
137,3,19,Kevin, Who makes it
138,3,19,Michael, Uh  MISSterious And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side thats the mystery
139,3,19,Phyllis, Look its got shoulderpads and did you see that lining
140,3,19,Michael, Okay
141,3,19,Phyllis, Did you see
142,3,19,Michael, Would you stop it please
143,3,19,Jim, So none of that tipped you off
144,3,19,Michael, Its European OK Its a European cut
145,3,19,Pam, Michael the pants dont have any pockets
146,3,19,Michael, No they dont See 
147,3,19,Pam, 
148,3,19,Michael, Italians dont wear pockets
149,3,19,Pam, Its been a really rough couple of days This helps a little
150,3,19,Karen, Hey maybe you want to come over and raid my closet
151,3,19,Michael, No I dont want to do that because Im twice your size anyway
152,3,19,Darryl, Yeah he look like Hillary Clinton
153,3,19,Michael, Um lets just do this in 15 minutes
154,3,19,Darryl, Okay can you just stand right there  I gotta send some emails
155,3,19,Michael, Negotiations are all about controlling things About being in the drivers seat And make one tiny mistake youre dead I made one tiny mistake I wore womans clothes
156,3,19,Kevin, Karen how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriends ass over another woman
157,3,19,Karen, I feel great Kevin Thank you
158,3,19,Stanley, You must have been scared out of your mind
159,3,19,Karen, Well you know it happened so fast I didnt really have time to be scared
160,3,19,Angela, What happened exactly I wasnt here so I havent really heard the whole story
161,3,19,Karen, Um well Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry
162,3,19,Angela, Mmhmm
163,3,19,Karen, And hes a big dude you know And all of a sudden Jim pushed me out of the way and Roy cocked his fist and then bam Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt
164,3,19,Angela,  Goodness
165,3,19,Karen, When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings Roy just attacked him Im not sure which one Jim hated more
166,3,19,Michael, Lets get down to business Why dont you tell me why you think you deserve a raise
167,3,19,Darryl, Well its simple Mike I mean we merged these two branches right So now were shipping twice as many orders as we used to With Roy gone we got a smaller crew And Im pickin up all of his slack so I think I should be compensated fairly by gettin a raise
168,3,19,Michael, 
169,3,19,Darryl, What I cant hear you
170,3,19,Michael,  That was a very good point
171,3,19,Darryl, I cant what Mike Are you
172,3,19,Michael,  You make a very compelling argument
173,3,19,Pam, Sorry I almost got you klled
174,3,19,Jim, Yeah that was nuts
175,3,19,Pam, He could have broken your nose or something Crazy Its just so stupid I mean getting back with Roy and everything I mean what was I thinking right
176,3,19,Jim, No I mean you guys really seem to have a strong connection
177,3,19,Pam, Not anymore Its um Its completely over now
178,3,19,Jim, Well see Im sure you guys will find you way back to one another someday
179,3,19,Pam, Jim I am really sorry
180,3,19,Jim, Oh yeah Dont worry about it
181,3,19,Michael, I am going to give you a piece of paper I want you to write down how much you want and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me
182,3,19,Darryl, Why cant I just tell you
183,3,19,Michael, Because that is the way these things are done In films  No slide slide it yes
184,3,19,Darryl, There you go
185,3,19,Michael, Oh  Come on Be serious
186,3,19,Darryl, I am serious Mike Thats a 10 raise Thats what I want
187,3,19,Michael, I I cant give you that I I dont make this much
188,3,19,Darryl, Come on be for real Mike
189,3,19,Michael, I dont Want me to prove it to you There is a pay stub

197,3,19,Michael, Ok lets take 15 again
198,3,19,Michael, A bosss salary isnt just about money it is about perks It for example every year I get a 100 gas card Cant put a price tag on that
199,3,19,Jim, Ok if you dont want a gift at least let me buy you a beer or lunch or something
200,3,19,Dwight, When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon and shts down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause do you think he does so for a free beer
201,3,19,Jim, Boy I
202,3,19,Dwight, No And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim whats your angle
203,3,19,Jim, Its like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back he never sees it coming But now I want to be nice to him and actually give him something and hes like an eel I just cant grab onto him Its infuriating
204,3,19,Karen, Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks
205,3,19,Jim, Well yes thats probably what it is So what do I do
206,3,19,Karen, Hmm I dont know Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip
207,3,19,Kevin, Michael heres the uh 15 I owe you
208,3,19,Michael, Oh thank you

216,3,19,Darryl, What

218,3,19,Darryl, Thats cause of you Mike Theyre not gonna give the workin man more than the boss
219,3,19,Michael, Well what am I supposed to do
220,3,19,Darryl, Get your own raise You gotta get out there and earn son
221,3,19,Michael, Im not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now That is ridiculous
222,3,19,Darryl, Well when they merged the two branches together they put you in charge Okay and were shippin more now than we ever have
223,3,19,Michael,  Thats true
224,3,19,Darryl, Yeah thats true You gotta call your girl and get paid Show her who wears the pants in the relationship

40,3,20,Michael, Yeeesh
41,3,20,Darryl, We do safety training every year or after an accident  Weve never made it a full year This particular time I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf when one office worker who shall remain nameless kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled
42,3,20,Michael,  Hey Darryl hows it hangin 
43,3,20,Darryl, And I fell and busted my ankle Im legitimately scared for my workers
44,3,20,Darryl, The baler can flatten a car engine It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat
45,3,20,Dwight, Yeah

65,3,20,Darryl, These are very dangerous machines down here and the upstairs workers Michael should not go anywhere near them
66,3,20,Michael, Yes yes But it wouldnt be the worst thing in the world if somebody
67,3,20,Darry, It would be the worst thing in the world It would Very much so
68,3,20,Lonny, What the hell is wrong with this man
69,3,20,Michael, Its a big red trash compactor
70,3,20,Lonny, What are you

77,3,20,Michael, Toby now has the floor and he is going to try not to screw this up like everything else in his life Let me rephrase that I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl Here we go
78,3,20,Toby, Ok um one thing that youre gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome Its recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour For your circulation youre gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh and move around about ten minutes every hour
79,3,20,Michael, Yes good Fine Like stretching and
80,3,20,Toby, Um yeah Youre computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes so uh its also recommended that you step away for about about ten minutes every hour
81,3,20,Michael, Wow that is that time really adds up Thats like a half an hour every hour
82,3,20,Darryl, Take them at the same time
83,3,20,Michael, Ok you know what Youre making it sound kind of lame So skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff Like sometimes computers can explode can they not
84,3,20,Toby, No no Um you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort in case it gets drafty

143,3,21,Jim, Not important Because youre not dating her Because its a felony
144,3,21,Andy, But who was that guy
145,3,21,Jim, Probably another highschool student
146,3,21,School Official, The issue with the watermark is very serious
147,3,21,Jim, Absolutely
148,3,21,School Official, We teach our students that character counts
149,3,21,Jim, And you should
150,3,21,School Official, But
151,3,21,Andy,  Pfft You dont teach it well enough One of your students is a bitch

164,3,21,Michael, The watermark its a one time thing
165,3,21,Barbara, I dont care It was disgusting Cartoon characters having sx

190,3,21,Michael, No then Newsweek picks it up And then CNN does a story about it Then YouTube gets a hold of it
191,3,21,Pam, You know what I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two

6,3,22,Dwight,  Lets put it this way You do not want to receive three of those
7,3,22,Jim, Lay it on me
8,3,22,Dwight, Three demerits and youll receive a citation
9,3,22,Jim, Now that sounds serious
10,3,22,Dwight, Oh it is serious Five citations and youre looking at a violation Four of those and youll receive a verbal warning Keep it up and youre looking at a written warning Two of those thatll land you in a world of hurt in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior
11,3,22,Jim, Which would be me
12,3,22,Dwight, That is correct
13,3,22,Jim, OK I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation
14,3,22,Dwight, Whats a dis whats that

29,3,22,Angela, Phyllis Youre a married woman
30,3,22,Creed, The guy was just hanging brain I mean whats all the fuss
31,3,22,Creed, If thats flashing then lock me up
32,3,22,Pam,  Its just like so creepy
33,3,22,Ryan,  Yeah 
34,3,22,Michael, Whats happening
35,3,22,Pam, Oh some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot
36,3,22,Michael, Really Is she OK
37,3,22,Pam, Yeah Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down
38,3,22,Michael, OK  Phyllis you say  Hmm 
39,3,22,Angela, What is so funny
40,3,22,Michael, Um I mean did he even see Pam Or uh Karen from behind
41,3,22,Kevin, Im guessing not
42,3,22,Michael,  Im sorry Its pretty funny when you think about it
43,3,22,Jim, Mm not really no
44,3,22,Pam, Its disgusting and demeaning
45,3,22,Michael, Oh OK Masters of comedy A guy dropped his pants Have you ever been to the circus  OK  Hes back  OK Hmm  Waagh 
46,3,22,Toby, Hey whats going on Theres a police car in the
47,3,22,Michael, What Oh 
48,3,22,Toby, Whats going on
49,3,22,Michael, Oh Phyllis got flashed Its uh 
50,3,22,Toby, I dont think laughing about it is an appropriate response
51,3,22,Michael, Oh come on We are laughing at Phyllis but shes not even here so no harm no foul
52,3,22,Toby, I dont think the women in this office 
53,3,22,Michael, Incidentally where were you during all of this Maybe youre the flasher
54,3,22,Toby, I was at a parentteacher conference
55,3,22,Michael, Uhhuh Prove it Lets see your pen1s  I you know as that was coming out of my mouth I knew that it was wrong
56,3,22,Michael, In all the excitement I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe Women cant have fun if they dont feel safe For example Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far Foliage And if one of us says that word the other one has to stop Although last time she pretended she didnt hear me
57,3,22,Jan,  Michael 
58,3,22,Michael, Huh
59,3,22,Jan, come over after work tonight OK I miss your body
60,3,22,Michael, I dont know I feel I drive a lot Im spending a fortune on gas and tolls 
61,3,22,Jan, Ill give you 200 And if I get up before you Ill leave it on the dresser
62,3,22,Michael, Um that I dont know That makes me kind of uncomfortable
63,3,22,Jan,300
64,3,22,Michael, I uh well I dont know
65,3,22,Jan, You know whatever Just let my assistant know if youre coming over so he can get more vodka OK Hunter are you on
66,3,22,Hunter,  You got it Jan
67,3,22,Dwight, Employees of this office are very small and delicate Deserve protection from local pervs Better 1000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free
68,3,22,Michael,  I am sick over this thing Those people out there are clearly afraid And that cant happen Not in my house
69,3,22,Dwight, Agreed Let me show you what Ive been working on
70,3,22,Michael, OK
71,3,22,Dwight,  There are several penises there Id love Phyllis to run her eyes over You know see if we can catch this pervert
72,3,22,Michael, This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now Dwight
73,3,22,Dwight, Look at that one
74,3,22,Michael, Dwight are those your pants Thats a Polaroid 
75,3,22,Michael, Attention everybody Dwight has something he would like to say
76,3,22,Dwight, Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis a man a map and his pen1s  I think you know what Im referring to  Michael has authorized me to form an emergency antiflashing task force
77,3,22,Jim,  Question Wont that interfere with your other task forces
78,3,22,Dwight, No because this is being given priority one This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot And I know I know what youre thinking  Wont that just shed more light on the penises But that is a risk we have to take Pam You can draw kind of Why dont you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community
79,3,22,Pam, Phallus
80,3,22,Dwight, Phyllis sorry Ive got penises on the brain Back to work everybody
81,3,22,Pam, I dont often miss Roy But I can tell you one thing I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy Because that would have been the asskicking of the year  Especially if it had been Jim He would not have wanted me to have seen Jims Whoo I am I am saying a lot of things
82,3,22,Phyllis, I didnt really get a good look
83,3,22,Pam, Thats OK I dont feel like answering phones
84,3,22,Karen, Hey did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out  Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 14 inch Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute This is ridiculous
85,3,22,Dwight, Attention I am removing all bananas from the kitchen
86,3,22,Karen, Dwight this memo that you distributed is insulting
87,3,22,Dwight, Desperate times call for desperate measures
88,3,22,Pam,  Sleeves down to the wrists buttonedup collars and muted colors Nobody dress like that 
89,3,22,Michael, OK you know something Dwight We are not the trrorists Why dont you just take these women put em in a burlap sack and hit em with a stick Because thats what youre doing I celebrate these women They deserve the right to dress as they please If Pam wants to show more cleavage she should be able to I encourage that
90,3,22,Karen, Look its really simple We just want you guys to treat us with respect
91,3,22,Michael, See Thats what were talking about Did you hear that Dwight
92,3,22,Dwight, Yes Did you hear that Michael
93,3,22,Michael, No Dwight Respect RESPsveeT Find out what it means to me All right you know what Thats it Conference room five minutes Womens appreciation
94,3,22,Jim, Wait a second how are you qualified for that
95,3,22,Michael, Oh I dont know James Did I come from a woman Have I slept with a woman More than one
96,3,22,Dwight,  Mm less than three
97,3,22,Michael, That is not current
98,3,22,Dwight, You know what Why doesnt Oscar run the meeting Hes a homosexual
99,3,22,Jim, Why dont you run the meeting You play with dolls
100,3,22,Dwight, Those are collectible action figures and theyre worth more than your car
101,3,22,Michael, You know what I am the expert I will conduct it I know the crap out of women
102,3,22,Michael, I um would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter
103,3,22,Creed, Are we still discussing this I say again what is the big deal
104,3,22,Michael, Nobody likes to be flashed When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party I nearly vomited
105,3,22,Meredith, I dont remember doing that
106,3,22,Angela, What a surprise
107,3,22,Michael, OK no catfights Please Lets  my point is my point is a pen1s when seen in the right context is the most wonderful sight for a woman But in the wrong context it is like a monster movie
108,3,22,Dwight, Alien Blagh
109,3,22,Michael, What are Shut it Shut Up OK so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about womens problems and issues and situations Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny tall goddesses Well look around Are women like that No No they are not  Even the hot ones arent really that skinny So what does that say That says that you women are up against it And it is criminal Society doesnt care Society sucks I dont even consider myself a part of society FYI Because I am so angry over all of this
110,3,22,Andy, If it were up to me you ladies would be the fashion models
111,3,22,Kevin, Yes Andy Then the fashion models could come here and work with me
112,3,22,Karen, What youre saying is extremely misogynistic
113,3,22,Michael, Yes Thank you That was not necessary but I appreciated it And I proves my point Women can do anything
114,3,22,Karen, Im saying that youre being sexist
115,3,22,Michael, No Im being misogynistic That is insane I am not being sexist
116,3,22,Karen, That  its the same thing
117,3,22,Phyllis, Michael
118,3,22,Michael, Yes
119,3,22,Phyllis, When I got my hair cut short you asked me if I was a lesbian
120,3,22,Michael, Because wha that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut
121,3,22,Angela, And when we get mad you always ask us if were on our periods
122,3,22,Michael, I have to know whether youre serious or not
123,3,22,Dwight, I wish I could menstruate
124,3,22,Dwight, If I could menstruate I wouldnt have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore Id just be able to count down from my previous cycle Plus Id be more in tune with the moon and the tides
125,3,22,Karen, Can we just get back to work
126,3,22,Michael, Ye  OK yes
127,3,22,Angela, This is not work talk
128,3,22,Michael, Youre right Youre right youre right And you know why Its because of where we are This is a masculine environment We need to find a place where you feel comfortable You know where were gonna go The Steamtown Mall 
129,3,22,Karen, Frankly its kind of insulting But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car So I could do that
130,3,22,Angela, Malls are just awful and humiliating Theyre just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a juniors section There are petite adults who are sort of smaller who need to wear maybe a kids size 10
131,3,22,Michael, OK lets go ladies of DunderMifflin Hey we should have a calendar printed up Pam put that in my good idea folder  Lets go

268,3,23,Jim, Hey I know what youre looking for but um I got to be honest I really dont think I should be considered as your replacement
269,3,23,Michael, You are being too modest

333,3,24/25,Dwight, Listen up Come to the center of the room please This  is a Schrute Buck When you have done something good you will receive one Schrute Buck One thousand Schrute Bucks equals an extra five minutes for lunch
334,3,24/25,Pam,  What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck
335,3,24/25,Dwight, Excellent question Pam 1100th of a cent
336,3,24/25,Oscar, So ten thousand of your dollars is worth one real dollar
337,3,24/25,Dwight, Just zip your lid Another announcement Michael wasted an enormous amount of the groups time and patience with nonwork related ethnic celebrations and parades of softminded dogoodedness No longer No more meetings
338,3,24/25,Stanley, Amen

174,4,2-Jan,Michael, Well I am taking responsibility It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car Im not superstitious but Im I am a littlestitious
175,4,2-Jan,Michael, Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground
176,4,2-Jan,Oscar, Like what
177,4,2-Jan,Michael, Like park on it Or dig up a body Toby Anything you want to tell us
178,4,2-Jan,Toby, No I did not violate an Indian burial ground In fact I had some good luck recently Alfredos Pizza picked my business card out of the basket so uh I got a week of free pies
179,4,2-Jan,Pam, Thats cool
180,4,2-Jan,Toby, Yeah
181,4,2-Jan,Michael, Perfect So our tragedy is your good luck Satan
182,4,2-Jan,Angela, Sprinkles never hurt a soul God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this She wasnt ready She had so much left to accomplish
183,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Shes only a cat
184,4,2-Jan,Angela, You never you dont like them
185,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat
186,4,2-Jan,Oscar, Dwight please
187,4,2-Jan,Michael, Dwight you havent seen Meredith yet have you
188,4,2-Jan,Dwight, No I have not
189,4,2-Jan,Michael, Well I think you should go to the hospital and pay your respects
190,4,2-Jan,Dwight, I do not respect her but I will go
191,4,2-Jan,Michael, Alright I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs
192,4,2-Jan,Toby, Oh Michael you cant ask about religious beliefs
193,4,2-Jan,Michael, Satan is a master of lies Everything he says is the opposite
194,4,2-Jan,Toby, Alright well then you can ask about religious beliefs
195,4,2-Jan,Michael, Thank you for the permission Psych Alright lets just go around the room and tell me what you believe in
196,4,2-Jan,Stanley, Im um Catholic
197,4,2-Jan,Michael, OK
198,4,2-Jan,Darryl, Presbyterian
199,4,2-Jan,Michael, Alright
200,4,2-Jan,Pam, Oh me too
201,4,2-Jan,Darryl, Oh
202,4,2-Jan,Pam,  Same religion
203,4,2-Jan,Darryl, Alright 
204,4,2-Jan,Phyllis, Im a Lutheran and Bobs a Unitarian It keeps things spicy
205,4,2-Jan,Angela, Thats why were cursed
206,4,2-Jan,Creed, Ive been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader
207,4,2-Jan,Michael, Kelly you are Hindu so you believe in Buddha
208,4,2-Jan,Kelly, Thats Buddhist
209,4,2-Jan,Michael, Are you sure
210,4,2-Jan,Kelly, No
211,4,2-Jan,Michael, What are you
212,4,2-Jan,IT Tech Guy, Well if youre going to reduce my identity to my religion then Im Sikh but I also like Hiphop and NPR and Im restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time
213,4,2-Jan,Michael, OK 1 Sikh and
214,4,2-Jan,Dwight, As a farmer I know that when an animal is sick sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery With the electricity were using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days You tell me whats unethical
215,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Blink once if you want me to pull the plug
216,4,2-Jan,Meredith, Dont pull any plugs
217,4,2-Jan,Intern, How are you doing Ms Palmer
218,4,2-Jan,Meredith, Better
219,4,2-Jan,Intern, Excellent
220,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Are you a doctor or a male nurse
221,4,2-Jan,Intern, Um Im an intern which makes me a doctor but
222,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Pfft Her chart doesnt indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did or at least she got time off for one
223,4,2-Jan,Intern, Ah so uh so that is where her uterus went Um Ms Palmer your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago
224,4,2-Jan,Meredith, Yes Dwight here trapped it in a bag against my head
225,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Just doing my job
226,4,2-Jan,Intern, It also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon
227,4,2-Jan,Meredith, And a rat Separate occasions
228,4,2-Jan,Michael, You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you and then you run over one person with your car  And its not even one of the popular ones and everybody gets on your case Doesnt make any sense God is dead
229,4,2-Jan,Kelly, If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now
230,4,2-Jan,Michael, Maybe believing in God was the mistake What did people believe in before The sun Maybe theres some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice too Like a giant buffalo or some sort of monster like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat Or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer with ah the body of a porcupine
231,4,2-Jan,Jim, I will do some research
232,4,2-Jan,Pam, I can help you with that
233,4,2-Jan,Dwight, So just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine
234,4,2-Jan,Michael, Oh God Rabies
235,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Mmhmm
236,4,2-Jan,Michael, I was in the hospital room with her How contagious is that is that like an STD
237,4,2-Jan,Dwight, No no Youve gotta be bitten by something
238,4,2-Jan,Michael, This place is so cursed
239,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in Lock jaw
240,4,2-Jan,Michael,  I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Merediths life by hitting her with my car But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened Dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it
241,4,2-Jan,Jim, Six of one really
242,4,2-Jan,Michael, Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life Curse is broken Curse is broken people  Oh there is a God and he has a plan for us after all So go home get some rest very very good work today We got a lot accomplished
243,4,2-Jan,Michael, Is there a God If not what are all the churches for And who is Jesus dad
244,4,2-Jan,Kevin,  Oh well if they arent together now then they probably never will be I thought theyd be good together like PBJ Pam Beasley and Jim What a waste What  A  Waste
245,4,2-Jan,Pam,  I told you Im not dating anyone And even if I was I dont think its anyones business I mean when I do fall in love like when its for real the last person Im gonna talk about it too is a camera crew or my coworkers  Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be  Trust me when I fall in love youll know
246,4,2-Jan,Pam, Michael Scotts DunderMifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer memorial celebrity rabies awareness fun run race for the cure this is Pam
247,4,2-Jan,Michael, ProAm
248,4,2-Jan,Pam, ProAm race for the They hung up
249,4,2-Jan,Michael, A woman shouldnt have to be hit by a car to learn that she may have rabies But that is where we are in America And that does not sit right with me And that is why Im hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US But not very many people know that
250,4,2-Jan,Stanley,  No rabies Babies would be a good idea Can I put you down for a dime
251,4,2-Jan,Michael, Hi Stanley how many sponsors so far
252,4,2-Jan,Stanley, Zero
253,4,2-Jan,Michael, Come on man gotta step it up Its for a good cause Jan called this morning and pledged 50000
254,4,2-Jan,Andy, Isnt that your money
255,4,2-Jan,Michael, That is for a good cause Phyllis hows the rabies quilt coming
256,4,2-Jan,Phyllis, Oh its coming
257,4,2-Jan,Michael, Oh look at that 3 Way to honor Meredith Phyllis
258,4,2-Jan,Kevin, Michael
259,4,2-Jan,Michael, Yes
260,4,2-Jan,Kevin, You cannot make me run
261,4,2-Jan,Michael, OK 
262,4,2-Jan,Kevin, It is not a real charity Its stupid Michael and Im not gonna do it
263,4,2-Jan,Michael, Alright alright
264,4,2-Jan,Kevin, You didnt run for me
265,4,2-Jan,Michael, Shhh
266,4,2-Jan,Kevin, when I thought I had skin cancer
267,4,2-Jan,Michael, I know that youre probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts
268,4,2-Jan,Kevin, No
269,4,2-Jan,Michael, OK well back in olden times a large fat person like this was a person of power A person who had money could buy food person of respect Like the regional manager of the day Whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was someone who worked in the fields And I was a peasant
270,4,2-Jan,Kevin, I just dont want to run I didnt bring my sneakers or my clothes
271,4,2-Jan,Michael, Well youre going to have to run or youre going to be in a lot of trouble It is not olden times anymore
272,4,2-Jan,Andy,  Im petrified of nipple chafing Once it starts it is a vicious circle If you have sensitive nipples they chafe so they become more sensitive so they chafe more So I take precautions 
273,4,2-Jan,Andy, Hey Angela Hey um Im sorry about your cat 
274,4,2-Jan,Angela, This is Sprinkles  She was my best friend I kept her going through countless ailments I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once and she is now deceased This is Halloween last year  just a couple of kittens  out on the town
275,4,2-Jan,Angela, Pssst Im having relationship problems And since youre always having relationship problems I thought youd be able to give me some advice
276,4,2-Jan,Pam, Whats wrong
277,4,2-Jan,Angela, I have this crazy thought that I know is crazy That maybe Dwight klled my cat
278,4,2-Jan,Pam, Hmm
279,4,2-Jan,Angela, When I got home Sprinkles body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds
280,4,2-Jan,Pam, Ah
281,4,2-Jan,Angela, Somethings not right The vets doing an autopsy
282,4,2-Jan,Pam, Angela Im sorry
283,4,2-Jan,Angela, Did Roy ever kll one of your cats
284,4,2-Jan,Pam, Im more of a dog person
285,4,2-Jan,Angela, 
286,4,2-Jan,Jim, So whats your strategy for this race
287,4,2-Jan,Pam, Well Im gonna start fast
288,4,2-Jan,Jim, Mmhmm
289,4,2-Jan,Pam, Then Im gonna run fast in the middle
290,4,2-Jan,Jim, What
291,4,2-Jan,Pam, Then Im gonna end fast
292,4,2-Jan,Jim, Why wont more people do that 
293,4,2-Jan,Pam, Cause theyre just stupid
294,4,2-Jan,Jim,  What
295,4,2-Jan,Jim,  Oh ah No thats not I mean that wasnt ah
296,4,2-Jan,Pam, Yeah That was um
297,4,2-Jan,Jim, I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh How it looks like um I mean now a days you can edit anything right I mean you can edit anything to look like um anything
298,4,2-Jan,Pam, Yeah I gave him a ride home because
299,4,2-Jan,Jim, Right
300,4,2-Jan,Pam,  Were dating
301,4,2-Jan,Jim, Wow There it is
302,4,2-Jan,Pam, Ah yeah We havent told anybody but its going really great  Right
303,4,2-Jan,Jim, It is going really great
304,4,2-Jan,Dwight,  Oww
305,4,2-Jan,Angela, Shut up
306,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Youre taking this out on me but I was only the messenger
307,4,2-Jan,Angela, Oh really
308,4,2-Jan,Dwight,  Youll feel better after the 5k Exercise is good for depression
309,4,2-Jan,Angela,  Im not depressed Im in grief
310,4,2-Jan,Michael, We have raised almost 70000 most of it from me and Jan Um when do they put that on the giant check Or is that something that we write in later
311,4,2-Jan,Pam, Well a giant check costs about 20000 to make up I have a print shop standing by but What do you think Michael thats over 25 of our funds
312,4,2-Jan,Michael, Hmm Thats a tough decision Um I always imagined it with a giant check So
313,4,2-Jan,Jim, Yeah I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check
314,4,2-Jan,Pam, Giant check it is
315,4,2-Jan,Jim, Yeah
316,4,2-Jan,Michael, Yep
317,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Well I dont know on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control
318,4,2-Jan,Jim, Bat birth control
319,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Wait this money is going to bat birth control right Michael thats what you told me when I contributed
320,4,2-Jan,Michael, You didnt contribute very much I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor And hows that been going
321,4,2-Jan,Pam, Not well A doctor wont come out to collect a check for 70000 or 50000 if we go with the giant check
322,4,2-Jan,Jim, Which we are
323,4,2-Jan,Pam, And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor
324,4,2-Jan,Michael, What about a rabies nurse
325,4,2-Jan,Pam, I dont think so
326,4,2-Jan,Jim, You know what though Ive actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour for parties and bachelor events
327,4,2-Jan,Michael, Thats possible Look into that
328,4,2-Jan,Jim, Great its gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah oh actually more with tips
329,4,2-Jan,Dwight, Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Merediths son
330,4,2-Jan,Michael, Have you met that kid Hes not going to college
331,4,2-Jan,Pam, Michael 5k means 5 kilometers not 5 thousand miles 
332,4,2-Jan,Michael, Come in
333,4,2-Jan,Pam, Hey
334,4,2-Jan,Michael, Hey hey hey
335,4,2-Jan,Pam, Oh my God
336,4,2-Jan,Michael, What are you doing
337,4,2-Jan,Pam, You said come in

342,4,2-Jan,Pam,  dangling participle
343,4,2-Jan,Jim, Eww
344,4,2-Jan,Pam,  still burned in my eyes
345,4,2-Jan,Jim, I can imagine
346,4,2-Jan,Pam,  Come in
347,4,2-Jan,Michael, May I enter the room
348,4,2-Jan,Pam, Yes Or come in
349,4,2-Jan,Michael, See how I did that Thats the way you should enter a room You knock and then you wait for the all clear
350,4,2-Jan,Jim, You couldnt have taken off all your clothes in the mens room
351,4,2-Jan,Michael, Yes but I have an office so why would I do that
352,4,2-Jan,Pam, On average how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office Just ballpark
353,4,2-Jan,Michael, European offices are naked all the time
354,4,2-Jan,Pam, Theyre so not
355,4,2-Jan,Michael, Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so
356,4,2-Jan,Pam, I didnt see where it started but I saw where it ended
357,4,2-Jan,Jim,  Gross
358,4,2-Jan,Michael, Thats not gross it is the human body What is your problem Pam youre an artist right Think of me as one of your models OK you know what I dont want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today its not fair to people with rabies And thats the point right OK lets go have some fun
359,4,2-Jan,Jim, Alright
360,4,2-Jan,Pam, They say if youre nervous around someone you should picture them naked I do not recommend this strategy Try picturing them with more clothes on or a funny coat
361,4,2-Jan,Jim,  Oh Im sorry is this a working office and not a French beach
362,4,2-Jan,Jan, OK name please
363,4,2-Jan,Creed, Creed Bratton 75 plus division

428,4,2-Jan,Dwight, I am a farmer Angela
429,4,2-Jan,Angela, What does that mean

447,4,2-Jan,Angela, You dont understand

457,4,2-Jan,Toby, He couldnt have made it a circle
458,4,2-Jan,Michael,  I am not going to finish I cant beat rabies Nobody can beat rabies rabies has been around for a thousand years I was a fool to think that I could beat it 
459,4,2-Jan,Jim, talk about it

463,4,2-Jan,Jim, Well youre probably dehydrated
464,4,2-Jan,Michael, What do you want me to do Jim
465,4,2-Jan,Jim, Glass of water would be a start
466,4,2-Jan,Michael, No There are people all over the world who have all sorts of problems and afflictions and diseases Theyre deformed and theyre abnormal and theyre illiterate and ugly Symphonies dont have any money Public TV is bust I cant do anything about it I cant you know Theres just one of me and theres a thousand of them And rabies wins

473,4,2-Jan,Michael, Pam if everybody felt that way nothing would get done
474,4,2-Jan,Pam, Yeah but theres other better people out there who are helping

478,4,2-Jan,Michael, Finishing that 5k was the hardest thing I have ever had to do I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water than I have in my entire life People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit well today I had a triumph of the human body Thats why everybody was applauding for me at the end My guts and my heart and while I eventually puked my guts out I never puked my heart out And Im very very proud of that
479,4,2-Jan,Meredith, Hey Michael
480,4,2-Jan,Michael, Hey Mer How ya doing
481,4,2-Jan,Meredith, Better
482,4,2-Jan,Michael, Its ironic isnt it I mean Im in the hospital for not getting enough water and youre in it for a disease that causes the fear of water
483,4,2-Jan,Meredith, Im in because you hit me with your car But I wanted to say I heard you were trying really hard so Im not mad at you anymore

185,4,4-Mar,Pam, In his office You can go right in
186,4,4-Mar,Jan,  Hey
187,4,4-Mar,Ryan, Jan

193,4,4-Mar,Ryan, Well you look great
194,4,4-Mar,Jan, Thank you thank you
195,4,4-Mar,Ryan, Scranton suits you
196,4,4-Mar,Jan, Best decision I ever made
197,4,4-Mar,Ryan, You were let go
198,4,4-Mar,Jan, You know what I love the beard Keep it forever 
199,4,4-Mar,Michael, Hey
200,4,4-Mar,Jan, Hey
201,4,4-Mar,Michael,  Hey what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles
202,4,4-Mar,Jan, What
203,4,4-Mar,Michael, I dont want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids
204,4,4-Mar,Jan, So whats Ryan doing here
205,4,4-Mar,Michael, Oh I dunno theyre launching a big new business plan New website blah blah blah Hes being a real twerp about it so its all about youth and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people
206,4,4-Mar,Jan, Hes such a snake
207,4,4-Mar,Michael, Well
208,4,4-Mar,Jan, I hope hes gets hit with an ageism suit
209,4,4-Mar,Michael, What is that word
210,4,4-Mar,Jan, Ageism Companies they cant discriminate against people due to old age Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck your old boss threatened us with a lawsuit so we had to back off
211,4,4-Mar,Michael, So older people have just as many rights as younger people
212,4,4-Mar,Jan, Yes Michael they do
213,4,4-Mar,Oscar, Creed
214,4,4-Mar,Creed, Yes sir
215,4,4-Mar,Oscar, Everything OK 
216,4,4-Mar,Creed, Everythings cool dude
217,4,4-Mar,Creed, Im thirty Well in November Ill be thirty
218,4,4-Mar,Ryan, Is there another meeting scheduled I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here
219,4,4-Mar,Pam, Michael told us to wait in here We dont know why
220,4,4-Mar,Ryan,  Ohh man
221,4,4-Mar,Michael, Good were all here we can get started
222,4,4-Mar,Ryan, Michael
223,4,4-Mar,Michael, Have a seat
224,4,4-Mar,Ryan, Were not doing this today
225,4,4-Mar,Michael, Have a seat Like everybody else
226,4,4-Mar,Ryan, OK This is
227,4,4-Mar,Michael, Still my office Ryan  Well there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today Well new ideas are fine but they are also illegal because they are a form of ageism What Yes I am right Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older I did
228,4,4-Mar,Toby, Technically hes right
229,4,4-Mar,Michael, Hey shut up Toby Look why do we as a society hate old people so much
230,4,4-Mar,Creed, Because theyre lame
231,4,4-Mar,Michael, No Creed no they are not In fact many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability Like the old lady from Titanic  Or the funny things that they can do like wheres the Beef   Yeah
232,4,4-Mar,Jim, Why do you have the Big picture up again You used that already when you burned your foot
233,4,4-Mar,Pam, Reusing the Ben Kingsley too

263,4,4-Mar,Michael, Inspirational What have we learned Well we have learned that you cant teach an old dog new tricks because its illegal and you will go to jail 
264,4,4-Mar,Pam, I think that I should help him get home
265,4,4-Mar,Michael, No No Dont help him He doesnt need help Pam  What a nice guy

532,4,4-Mar,Dwight,  Well bill you
533,4,4-Mar,Michael, May I have your attention please This office will not be using any new technology ever starting now
534,4,4-Mar,Ryan, That is not correct
535,4,4-Mar,Michael, Ryan thinks that technology is the answer Well guess what I just drove my car into a lake
536,4,4-Mar,Oscar, You did what
537,4,4-Mar,Michael, I drove my car into a  lake Why you may ask did I do this Well because of a machine A machine told me to drive into a lake And I did it I did it because I trusted Ryans precious technology and look where it got me
538,4,4-Mar,Jim, Into a lake
539,4,4-Mar,Michael, Exactly
540,4,4-Mar,Phyllis, Did you get any clients back
541,4,4-Mar,Michael, Maybe maybe not time will tell But I will tell you one thing Those gift baskets never endangered anybodys lives  Game set match point Scott game over end of game
542,4,4-Mar,Michael, Everyone always wants new things Everybody likes new inventions new technology People will never be replaced by machines In the end life and business are about human connections And computers are about trying to mrder you in a lake And to me the choice is easy
543,4,4-Mar,Ryan, Im not saying I had a meteoric rise but I did And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now they wouldnt be giving me a noogie  It was two hundred dollars
544,4,4-Mar,[ New Scene ],
545,4,4-Mar,Ryan, You should come visit The city is amazing
546,4,4-Mar,Jim, I know I love it there
547,4,4-Mar,Ryan, No You dont know until you live there Theres something about waking up every morning and just being in that city
548,4,4-Mar,Jim, Mmhmm yeah last time I was there I had a lot of fun
549,4,4-Mar,Ryan, No You cant imagine it though The energy when youre actually there Youre just part of something bigger than you thats moving faster than you Your dreams are  it just everything feels so limitless
550,4,4-Mar,Jim, Sounds great
551,4,4-Mar,Ryan, No It eh you cant its not about how it sounds
552,4,4-Mar,Jim, Yeee 
0,4,6-May,Michael, And the same thing goes for quarterly reports They are unreadable Theyre just numbers and boring and blech So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic like if we have a bad quarter put in a storm cloud And when we have a good quarter fireworks Or a racecar  Doesnt have to be a racecar Use your imagination
1,4,6-May,Jim, Theres this cube on the screen and it bounces around all day and sometimes it looks like its heading right into the corner of the screen and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room Okay I believe she thinks she saw it
2,4,6-May,Pam, I saw it I saw it and it was amazing Who said I didnt see it Did Jim say that I didnt see it I saw it
3,4,6-May,Michael, We have a lot of colored paper here why oh why do we keep printing this on white 
4,4,6-May,Andy, Dah Come on
5,4,6-May,Michael, Yeah I know I know Its bland
6,4,6-May,Oscar, Its never gonna happen
7,4,6-May,Kevin, Dude you gotta believe
8,4,6-May,Michael, Maybe we could have some sort of riddle
9,4,6-May,Jim,  Wait for it
10,4,6-May,Michael, Like something that you have to look for Sort of a Wheres Waldo 
11,4,6-May,Everyone, Oh Yes

249,4,8-Jul,Creed, Michael is right Its a madeup word used to trick students
250,4,8-Jul,Andy, No Actually whomever is the formal version of the word
251,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Obviously its a real word but I dont know when to use it correctly
252,4,8-Jul,Michael, Not a native speaker
253,4,8-Jul,Kevin, I know whats right but Im not gonna say because youre all jerks who didnt come see my band last night
254,4,8-Jul,Ryan, Do you really know which one is correct

261,4,8-Jul,Kelly, Ryan used me an object
262,4,8-Jul,Stanley, Is he right about that
263,4,8-Jul,Pam, How did he use it again

265,4,8-Jul,Michael, Thank you
266,4,8-Jul,Toby, To whomever meaning us the indirect object Which is the correct usage of the word

268,4,8-Jul,Ryan, Wait This doesnt matter And I dont even care Michael you quit the other job or youre fired here
269,4,8-Jul,Michael, Ive never done this before Ive never quit anything in my life So you are filming history
270,4,8-Jul,Michael, Nick I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company
271,4,8-Jul,Mr. Figaro, Lipophedrine
272,4,8-Jul,Michael, And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin
273,4,8-Jul,Mr. Figaro, Never heard of it
274,4,8-Jul,Michael, In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully and I loved it and everybody loved me But the truth is I cant do this
275,4,8-Jul,Mr. Figaro, Are you quitting
276,4,8-Jul,Michael, I am
277,4,8-Jul,Mr. Figaro, Come back anytime dont forget to disinfect your headset
278,4,8-Jul,Michael, I was never in this for the money But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me I tried to live the dream I tried to have a job a girlfriend another job and I failed But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep and try it all again the next night
279,4,8-Jul,Andy, So
280,4,8-Jul,Pam, Whats up
281,4,8-Jul,Andy, Me All night Dreaming about Angelas smoking hot body

294,4,8-Jul,Pam, Thats right you did
295,4,8-Jul,Andy, Yeah

327,4,8-Jul,Pam, Doesnt Jan have money
328,4,8-Jul,Michael, I dont talk to my girlfriend about money It is rude and unsexual
329,4,8-Jul,Kevin, True its best to hide our money problems from women

333,4,8-Jul,Darryl, Hey lets call this what it is
334,4,8-Jul,Darryl, Its like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around Its gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door
335,4,8-Jul,Kelly, Well I just need to know where this is going
336,4,8-Jul,Darryl, Hey I like you Oh yeah whats not to like But you need to access your uncrazy side otherwise maybe this things run its course

340,4,8-Jul,Creed, Hey cuz heard youre having money problems
341,4,8-Jul,Michael, No you didnt
342,4,8-Jul,Creed, Listen Ive got the answer You declare bankruptcy all your problems go away
343,4,8-Jul,Creed, Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy When Creed Bratton gets in trouble he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider
344,4,8-Jul,Michael, How would that help Creed In Monopoly when you go bankrupt you lose
345,4,8-Jul,Creed, You dont go by Monopoly man that game is nuts Nobody just picks up get out of jail free cards those things cost thousands
346,4,8-Jul,Michael, That is a good point
347,4,8-Jul,Creed, Bankruptcy Michael is natures doover Its a fresh start its a clean slate
348,4,8-Jul,Michael, Like the witness protection program
349,4,8-Jul,Creed, Exactly
350,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Not at all
351,4,8-Jul,Michael, Ive always wanted to be in the witness protection program Fresh start no debts no baggage Ive already got my name picked out Lord Rupert Everton Im a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs Thats the life
352,4,8-Jul,Michael, I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY
353,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Hey I just wanted you to know that you cant just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen
354,4,8-Jul,Michael, I didnt say it I declared it
355,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Still thats not anything
356,4,8-Jul,Oscar, This is a lot of credit card debt
357,4,8-Jul,Michael, Yeah tell me about it
358,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Mmm
359,4,8-Jul,Michael, You know Jan has my credit cards and shes using them as if Im made of money she thinks Im a human ATM machine
360,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Okay a hundred and twentyfive dollars Amazon
361,4,8-Jul,Michael, Oh thats the Muppet Show on DVD classic
362,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Twelve hundred dollars Whats a Core Blaster Extreme
363,4,8-Jul,Michael, That is by far the best way to strengthen your core This machine you sit on a stabilizer ball you put your feet into the power stirups you reach up and you grab onto the super rod and you twist and you twist and you twist It strengthens your entire core Your back core your arm core the Marine Core actually uses it I think thats how they got a core
364,4,8-Jul,Andy, I left a little present for Angela I think shes going to like it because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her that they were destined to be together I got game
365,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Okay the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need like a car and a house
366,4,8-Jul,Michael, Mmhm That is so cool how you have my name at the top
367,4,8-Jul,Oscar, The red bar is what you spend on nonessentials like magazines entertainment things like that
368,4,8-Jul,Michael, Right
369,4,8-Jul,Oscar, This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever ever needs like multiple magic sets professional bass fishing equipment
370,4,8-Jul,Michael, How do they do this so fast Is this powerpoint
371,4,8-Jul,Pam, Man Angela really had a hold on him  Angela
372,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Michael Im going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator you meet with this guy
373,4,8-Jul,Michael, No no we are going to leave Jan out of this
374,4,8-Jul,Oscar, She has to know
375,4,8-Jul,Michael, We will find another way well ask powerpoint
376,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Michael this is a presentation tool
377,4,8-Jul,Michael, Youre a presentation tool if you think Im gonna tell Jan about this
378,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Im done
379,4,8-Jul,Michael, No youre not Ok just youre not a tool Look well tell her that its bad but it couldve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half
380,4,8-Jul,Oscar, Jan is smart
381,4,8-Jul,Michael, She poses
382,4,8-Jul,Jim, Dwight hows the hotel business

387,4,8-Jul,Dwight, Maybe you should Whatever
388,4,8-Jul,Pam, We wrote a good review Under comments we wrote the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times
389,4,8-Jul,Jim, The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings
390,4,8-Jul,Pam, Table making never seemed so possible
391,4,8-Jul,Jim, You will never want to leave your room
392,4,8-Jul,Pam, The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm

3,4,9,Michael, We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today Our first ad ever Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so its uh not too shabby
4,4,9,Andy, Best ad ever  Gimme a break gimme a break break me off a piece of that I am totally blanking What is the thing
5,4,9,Jim, Nobody tell him

21,4,9,Ad guy 2, Hey Michael nice to meet you
22,4,9,Michael, Excited to talk ideas
23,4,9,Ad guy 1, Lets do it man
24,4,9,Michael, You know I want this to be cutting edge I want it to be fast quick cuts you know youthful sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing
25,4,9,Ad guy 1, That sounds great
26,4,9,Michael, All right good well this is what we have to work with
27,4,9,Michael, I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard The Nard Dog Who let the Nard Dog out
28,4,9,Andy, Hoo hoo hoohoo

31,4,9,Michael, Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe
32,4,9,Stanley, Urban I grew up in a small town What about me seems urban to you
33,4,9,Michael, Stanley is hilarious Phyllis is like our Mrs Butterworth Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima
34,4,9,Michael, These are our accountants And as you can see they are very different sizes What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear Mama Bear Baby Bear thing That might be kind of fun
35,4,9,Kevin,  Mama Bear
36,4,9,Michael, Who else
37,4,9,Jim, I think its great that the companys making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us I mean when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin they think that we sell mufflers or muffins or mittens or And frankly all of those sound better than paper so I let it slide
38,4,9,Jim, You playing that game again
39,4,9,Dwight, Second Life is not a game It is a multiuser virtual environment It doesnt have points or scores it doesnt have winners or losers
40,4,9,Jim, Oh it has losers
41,4,9,Dwight, I signed up for Second Life about a year ago Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight Absolutely everything was the same Except I could fly 
42,4,9,Michael,  Little girl in a field holding a flower we zoom back to find that shes in the desert and the field is an oasis Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the worlds largest resort hotel Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the worlds largest prison But we zoom back further
43,4,9,Ad guy 1, Okay I can tell that your time is valuable
44,4,9,Michael, Actually I dont get paid by the hour anymore but thank you I get paid by the year so
45,4,9,Ad guy 1, That all sounds really really ambitious
46,4,9,Michael, Yeah I know
47,4,9,Ad guy 1, Why dont we show you what we did with the Nashua branch
48,4,9,Michael, Mmm Okay 
49,4,9,Michael, Thats what Nassau came up with That sucks  Whoa
50,4,9,Ad guy 1, Thats what we came up with
51,4,9,Michael, Well we can do better than that
52,4,9,Ad guy 2, Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same actually
53,4,9,Ad guy 1, Yeah its the last five seconds where we have some leeway
54,4,9,Michael, The waving
55,4,9,Ad guy 1, Well no no You dont have to be waving That was just what they did You guys can be clapping Sitting Standing outside inside whatever This is where you really get to be creative
56,4,9,Andy, I need some advice Ive been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately But weve been necking but only necking Right Not actually kissing our mouths just the neck on neck Its just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together Its hot Im not going to lie to you  but its a little weird but you seem like a guy with answers so how do I fast track this to get to first base
57,4,9,Dwight, We cannot talk about this because someone might hear us
58,4,9,Andy, Well use code names
59,4,9,Dwight, Angela can stay the same but well change Andy to Dwight
60,4,9,Andy, Thats not different enough
61,4,9,Dwight, Dwike
62,4,9,Receptionist, You have a call from Eddie Murphy

67,4,9,Ryan, I told you not to call about small problems
68,4,9,Michael, Yeah well when I call about big problems you dont like that either so make up you mind kiddo Here is the deal the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box and sort of ignoring my ideas
69,4,9,Ryan, Thats good Theyre creative youre not
70,4,9,Michael, Im creative Ryan
71,4,9,Ryan, Its not part of your job its like maybe you can cook but it doesnt mean you should start a restaurant

73,4,9,Ryan, Okay Im not really interested in that right now Im delegating creativity to creative professionals Its a different skills set Look I wasnt good at sales right
74,4,9,Michael, Yeah
75,4,9,Ryan, But Im good at managing people who do sales 
76,4,9,Michael, Are you I dont think youre doing such a good job here suppressing ideas and creativity
77,4,9,Michael, All right let me ask you this tell me if you think this is creative When I was five I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn And this is before I had even heard of one or seen one I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows and had a huge spike in its head And I was five five years old Couldnt even talk yet

156,4,9,Phyllis,  Well I got in line to buy Sue Graftons book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you but I wasnt supposed to take no for an answer
157,4,9,Michael, Thata girl
158,4,9,Phyllis, So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends
159,4,9,Michael, Did you or did you not get Sue Grafton
160,4,9,Phyllis,  No
161,4,9,Michael, Ugh can somebody give her a tissue please

163,4,9,Pam, Maybe but its not good enough for me yet
164,4,9,Jim, Okay Do you want me to stay
165,4,9,Pam, No no you can go home Im good

173,4,9,Jim, Youre welcome
174,4,9,Pam,45 AM And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide
175,4,9,Andy, Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night
176,4,9,Dwight, Andy I cant hear this right now
177,4,9,Andy, No no no no this is good You know how we havent really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet Well last night that changed Were makin out Im kissin her neck and cheek and her ear lobe and shes not really kissing me back But she closes her eyes and shes like Oh D oh D

190,4,9,Michael,  Well its been tough The uh geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest
191,4,9,Everyone,  Oh 
192,4,9,Bartender, Hey it seemed like a big hit
193,4,9,Michael, No it was stupid People like waving waving sells Its not art Yet we made our ad the real one was full of humor and full of depth and full heart and it was real
194,4,9,Jim, Hey could you do me a favor Could you put that in the DVD player
195,4,9,Jim, Hey everybody Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial the Michael Scott directors cut Hope you like it
196,4,9,Michael's Ad,  It all starts with an idea But you can never tell where an idea will end up  Because ideas spread they change grow They connect us with the world  And in a fast moving world where good news moves at the speed of time  and bad news isnt always what it seems  Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance  To score  Dunder Mifflin Limitless paper in a paperless world
197,4,9,Everyone, 
198,4,9,Jim, Animation All her by the way 
199,4,9,Bartender, Really

2,4,10,Rolando, Karen Hes on line one
3,4,10,Karen, Thanks Ro Hey we finally connected Hows Scranton
4,4,10,Karen, I am the regional manager of DunderMifflin Utica branch Turns out its a pretty easy gig when your boss isnt an idiot and your boyfriends not in love with somebody else
5,4,10,Karen, Look All Im saying is it would be a great opportunity and wed love to have you come aboard So think about it okay Okay bye
6,4,10,Karen, Look for the record a certain Scranton salesman approached me okay
7,4,10,Michael, This is perfect
8,4,10,Dwight, He looks like your twin
9,4,10,Michael, This is a dummy a la Ferris Buellers Day Off We have tied a string to the wrist which goes to the door When somebody opens the door the hand goes down hits the remote turns on the tape recorder which is me snoring Now nobody knows whether I am here or whether I am gone
10,4,10,Dwight, I will know
11,4,10,Michael, But you will not tell anyone
12,4,10,Dwight, I wont need to because well be together playing hooky Yeah
13,4,10,Michael, Well sometimes Most of the time I will be with Ryan or Darryl  Yes Oh good good Stanley First victim this is what I want you to do Go out come back in Were going to hide I want you to tell me if this looks like me okay
14,4,10,Stanley, I dont understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here
15,4,10,Michael, Just go out and come back in
16,4,10,Stanley, I got an offer from Utica for more money and Im going to take it
17,4,10,Michael, What
18,4,10,Michael, Hey everyone can I have your attention please I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there
19,4,10,All, 
20,4,10,Michael, No no no no nono no no You completely misinterpreted my tone this is a horrible thing Clearly Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her
21,4,10,Jim, Oh I dont think that is whats happening
22,4,10,Michael, Okay smarty pants then why Why is she trying to take Stanley from us
23,4,10,Stanley, I think its because of my sales record
24,4,10,Michael, That could not possibly be it
25,4,10,Michael, You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary The bluesy wisdom the sassy remarks the crossword puzzles the smile those big watery red eyes I dont know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley they have another thing coming
26,4,10,Michael, How can I get you to stay

39,4,11,Michael, Im sick of it Jim Im sick of this place
40,4,11,Michael, When Jan and I had satellite we used to watch a reality show called Survivorman And it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die try not to get eaten by an animal or be overexposed
41,4,11,Michael, OK I will only need two things Roll of duct tape and a knife
42,4,11,Dwight,  Im on it

45,4,11,Michael, Hey hey hey Dwight  Dwight
46,4,11,Dwight, I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office I saved Jims life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk People say Oh its dangerous to keep wapons in the home or the work place Well I say Its better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally than by a stranger on purpose
47,4,11,Michael, Dwight and I are going out He will return later but I will not I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow and perhaps the next day
48,4,11,Pam, Do you want me to ask where youre going

60,4,11,Jim, Thatd be great
61,4,11,Dwight, no I do not
62,4,11,Michael, This is what a true survivor man does You simulate a disaster like a plane wreck You could only wear the clothes that you have on and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets Now in this case this disaster is a serial kller Creepy guy whos abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead
63,4,11,Dwight, No I would never leave you for dead You would never escape
64,4,11,Michael, Well yes I would And I would survive
65,4,11,Dwight, I would make sure that you were dead
66,4,11,Michael, Well
67,4,11,Dwight, First I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified
68,4,11,Michael, You
69,4,11,Dwight, And they would call me the Overkill kller
70,4,11,Michael, You you are as creepy as a real serial kller For real  OK
71,4,11,Dwight, What are you doing
72,4,11,Michael, I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings Now this way I cant retrace my steps I dont know what streets weve been  Ow What are you doing
73,4,11,Dwight, It would be better if you were unconscious
74,4,11,Michael, No Gosh Dwight  Stop it stop it Stop it
75,4,11,Dwight, Do you want to do this right or not
76,4,11,Michael, Just please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life
77,4,11,Angela, Jim we need to order a cake for Creeds birthday
78,4,11,Jim, Oh wasnt it just someones birthday
79,4,11,Angela, Yes Kellys was last week remember
80,4,11,Jim, I do remember yeah
81,4,11,Angela, Its birthday month Creeds is today Oscars is week after next Merediths is at the end of the month  Michael usually goes with red and white streamers
82,4,11,Jim, You know what I have an idea Why dont we just do one big shared party
83,4,11,Angela, What
84,4,11,Jim, There are thirteen people working in this office so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast There are two types of toasts One is a joke about how old you are
85,4,11,Michael,  Look at those wrinkles Blacks do crack Not crack the drug
86,4,11,Jim, And the other is something inappropriate Or horrible Or both What else He only sings the high harmony to Happy Birthday And hes a very big believer in surprise parties Maybe even arguably possibly to a fault
87,4,11,Michael,  Happy Birthday
88,4,11,Kelly, Ahhh 
89,4,11,Michael,  Happy Birthday
90,4,11,Oscar, Ahhh

96,4,11,Pam, Wow Youre shaking things up a bit huh

88,4,12,Michael, Well it was not just termination It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior
89,4,12,Lester, Oh Very good Well put
90,4,12,Jan, People underestimate Michael There are plenty of things that he is well above average at Like ice skating He is a very good ice skater
91,4,12,Pam, Hey Kevin Jim needs to see you

96,4,12,Kevin,  Oh awesome 
97,4,12,Lester, How long have you known the plaintiff
98,4,12,Michael, I havent actually seen it But I have seen the firm and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
99,4,12,Lester, How long have you known Ms Levinson
100,4,12,Michael, Six years and two months
101,4,12,Lester, And you were directly under her the entire time
102,4,12,Michael, Thats what she said
103,4,12,Lester, Excuse me
104,4,12,Michael, Thats what she said
105,4,12,Lester, Ms Levinson told you she was your direct superior
106,4,12,Michael, Uh whwhy would she say that
107,4,12,Jan, Can we just move on to another question
108,4,12,Diane, No wait I dont understand Whos on record on saying this
109,4,12,Lester, With all due respect Im in the middle of a line of questioning Now Mr Scott what did you say Ms Levinson said Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position
110,4,12,Michael, Come again Thats what she said I dont know what youre talking about
111,4,12,Jan, Okay if I may he was just telling a joke before so can we move on to another question
112,4,12,Lester, Oh are you sure
113,4,12,Jan, Uh yes
114,4,12,Lester, Can you go back to where this digression began
115,4,12,Deposition Reporter, Thats what she said
116,4,12,Michael, Well delivery is all wrong Shes butchering it
117,4,12,Kelly,  Yeah thats what I thought
118,4,12,Lester, Did Ms Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired
119,4,12,Michael, She thought it had to do with the twins Thats what I call them
120,4,12,Lester, Can you be more specific Who are the twins
121,4,12,Michael, Um to be delicate they hang off miladys chest They make milk
122,4,12,Lester, You dont need to go any further Her breasts
123,4,12,Michael, Yes
124,4,12,Lester, She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery
125,4,12,Michael, Yes and frankly the timing was nothing short of predominant
126,4,12,Lester, What about your romantic relationship with Ms Levinson Could that have played a part in her termination
127,4,12,Michael, Well if it did then the company is breaking its own rules
128,4,12,Lester, Interesting How so
129,4,12,Michael, Because before we started dating we disclosed our relationship to HR And I have the proof right here 
130,4,12,Diane, Okay the company has just a few clarifying questions Mr Scott if thats okay with you
131,4,12,Michael, I will allow it
132,4,12,Diane, Um would you mind please just uh taking a quick look at uh this photograph please 
133,4,12,Michael, Uh
134,4,12,Diane, That is you and Ms Levinson in Jamaica is that correct
135,4,12,Michael, Uhhuh
136,4,12,Diane, And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship Does that sound right Mr Scott the timeline here is actually very important Please when did your relationship actually begin
137,4,12,Michael, Ugh Well dedepends on how you define begin I mean if it was from the first time we shook hands thats like six years ago If its from the first time we kissed thats like two years ago
138,4,12,Diane, Wait excuse me
139,4,12,Michael, If it was the first time we kissed sober it was like four months after that
140,4,12,Lester, Could we take a short break
141,4,12,Diane, No uh are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here
142,4,12,Michael, Line
143,4,12,Diane, Im sorry what
144,4,12,Man, He asked for a line like in a play
145,4,12,Deposition Reporter,  Mr Scott do you realize you just contradicted yourself I did Yes you did Can I go to the bathroom No I really have to Ive been drinking lots of water You went five minutes ago That wasnt to go to the bathroom that was to get out of a question You still have to answer it First can I go to the bathroom No

150,4,12,Jim,  What the hell
151,4,12,Dwight, I told you
152,4,12,Dwight, All of my heroes are table tennis players Zoran Primorac JanOve Waldner Wang Tao Jrg Rokopf and of course Ashraf Helmi I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba
153,4,12,Michael, Jan and I had an off again on again relationship for two years And I know this destroys her case and I am sorry but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition
154,4,12,Diane Kelly, Thank you Mr Scott Thats all we needed to know
155,4,12,Lester, Wait wed like to enter to the record a page from Michael Scotts personal journal
156,4,12,Michael, Whoa whoa whoa whoa What are you doing with my diary
157,4,12,Lester, This is plaintiffs exhibit 107 I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year Just got back from Jamaica Tan almost everywhere Jan almost everywhere Hehe Oh diary what a week I had sx with my boss I dont know if its going to go anywhere Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere that it was a one time mistake But we had sx six times so you tell me I am definitely feeling very eerie
158,4,12,Michael, Irie
159,4,12,Lester, Irie sorry More tomorrow xoxo Michael It would appear that neither you nor Ms Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word Is that correct
160,4,12,Diane Kelly, Were gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed
161,4,12,Michael, I dont think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary
162,4,12,Diane Kelly, Its basic discovery We have the right to review it
163,4,12,Man, OK lets make ten copies of this diary
164,4,12,Toby, Um can you make it eleven
165,4,12,Man, Eleven sure And well break for lunch so everyone can have a look
166,4,12,Michael,  Can I sit here
167,4,12,Toby,  You know I uh I know a little about what youre going through in a way Um when I was a kid my parents got divorced They both wanted custody and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court So I dont know I didnt want them getting divorced in the first place you know I loved them both so much I just wanted 
168,4,12,Michael, How can you give up my diary like that
169,4,12,Jan, I had to Im sorry but I need to win this We need to win this
170,4,12,Michael, Howd you even find it
171,4,12,Jan, You keep it under my side of the mattress
172,4,12,Michael, I dont like lump Im really upset about this
173,4,12,Jan, Alright I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company Lets call it even
174,4,12,Michael, Fine I love you
175,4,12,Jan, I love you too
176,4,12,Diane Kelly,  Mr Scott who is this other woman Ryan Who you refer to her as Just as hot as Jan but in a different way
177,4,12,Michael, Not a woman just a cool great looking best friend
178,4,12,Lester, Arent we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair Not Michael and this Ryan person
179,4,12,Toby,  Excuse me
180,4,12,Michael, Alright alright This is the way I see it Yes I had sx with Jan and yes I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend However Jan clearly didnt consider me to be her boyfriend So her actions are completely rightful
181,4,12,Diane Kelly, OK Mr Scott its its admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you
182,4,12,Michael, Thank you very much You didnt have to say that
183,4,12,Diane Kelly, Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews
184,4,12,Michael, That was before our relationship She was going through a divorce and she was drinking a lot  of water
185,4,12,Diane Kelly, Mr Scott this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review Would you mind uh reading the date on that please 
186,4,12,Michael, March 17th
187,4,12,Diane Kelly, And that would be a month after your relationship became official is that correct
188,4,12,Michael, Yes
189,4,12,Diane Kelly, You may read the uh highlighted portion out loud if youd like to
190,4,12,Michael,  I am out of carrots I am out of sticks Mr Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee and a poor branch manager I recommend he be removed from that position and reassigned to sales where he belongs
191,4,12,Diane Kelly, Mr Scott after hearing that wouldnt you say Ms Levinsons judgment is at least very seriously flawed
192,4,12,Michael, 
193,4,12,Diane Kelly, Mr Scott
194,4,12,Pam,  Hows it going
195,4,12,Dwight, Well he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable
196,4,12,Jim, Check this out though spin serve  Well it works like 80 of the time so
197,4,12,Pam, Nice So should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now
198,4,12,Jim, I think Im ready

202,4,12,Michael, How can you do that to me
203,4,12,Jan, 
204,4,12,Lester, You can respond just remember its all going into the record
205,4,12,Jan, Michael I am not the enemy OK Dunder Mifflin is the enemy
206,4,12,Michael, Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect with loyalty They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it
207,4,12,Jan, Alright wait Before you go any further let me show you what kind of loyalty they have OK Lester please read that part of Wallaces deposition
208,4,12,Lester, Yes
209,4,12,Michael, See I was his number 1 contender I was being groomed
210,4,12,Lester, Michael Scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years
211,4,12,Council, No
212,4,12,Lester, I have one more question Mr Scott Wouldnt you agree with Ms Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees
213,4,12,Michael, Absolutely not
214,4,12,Pam,  Yes Way to go  See that
215,4,12,Kelly, Yeah the floppy haired girl you date won a point

235,4,12,Michael, I think youre a nice guy too
236,4,12,David, Thanks Michael
237,4,12,Michael, Why did I do it I dont know Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary But she already brought the diary with her to New York so You expect to get screwed by your company but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend
238,4,12,Michael,  What do you want to do for dinner
239,4,12,Jan, How about Chinese
240,4,12,Michael, Sure trying to save some money get something cheap

281,4,13,Pam,  One night
0,4,14,Pam, WB Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get
1,4,14,Jim, So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there
2,4,14,Pam, Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street Tell them what we saw today Jim
3,4,14,Jim, Oh today we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken
4,4,14,Pam, Nature
5,4,14,Oscar, Been here nine years Now all of a sudden Im supposed to park half a mile away
6,4,14,Andy, I lost a penny out of my loafers Oscar

9,4,14,Kevin,  Hurts like hell
10,4,14,Pam,  Did you pick a new chair Its been awhile
11,4,14,Michael, Pam when I first opened this catalog I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair
12,4,14,Pam, But instead you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair
13,4,14,Pam, Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago And normally I wouldnt care but he promised me his old one Its way better Its one of these  I really want it
14,4,14,Michael,  Have you ever seen this woman
15,4,14,Pam, Her
16,4,14,Michael, Hmm

18,4,14,Michael, Look at her smile Those eyes look at her eyes Shes got  I dont know what it is actually she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch
19,4,14,Pam, Or in a great chair
20,4,14,Michael, Oh yeah maybe but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women
21,4,14,Pam, I definitely remember your dinner party
22,4,14,Michael, I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman  Jan I think that fate put this catalog in my hands
23,4,14,Pam, Actually I put the catalog in your hands cause you have to pick out a new chair
24,4,14,Michael, What is it like being single I like it I like starting each day with a sense of possibility And Im optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results
25,4,14,Michael, Ladies and gentleman would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85 
26,4,14,Creed,  Yo is this his new chair
27,4,14,Pam,  No he hasnt picked one yet

129,4,16,Michael, Great
130,4,16,Dwight, However in so doing it zigs past your name hence zagging you and making you appear weak Thus the yellow color Yellow for cowardly

186,4,16,Jim, A formal warning 
187,4,16,Ryan, Its actually not a joke I know how you spend your time here and I know how little you care about your job And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception we wouldnt be having this conversation
188,4,16,Jim,  Im sorry is is this because I talked to Wallace about your website Because I really didnt mean to go over your head
189,4,16,Ryan, This is nothing to do with that alright I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance I thrive on it
190,4,16,Jim, Im sorry then do you mind explaining a little better Cause Im not sure whats really
191,4,16,Ryan, Woah dont get all defensive alright Its just a warning If you want the details Toby can provide them You take it easy alright

35,4,18/19,Kelly, I feel weird
36,4,18/19,Michael, First thing on the agendaactually the only thing on the agenda is the status of Tobys going away party
37,4,18/19,Angela, We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby
38,4,18/19,Michael, Okay
39,4,18/19,Angela, But so far we only have two pictures of him
40,4,18/19,Michael, Okay well this will not do Toby is going away forever and uh we need to do something very very special In some cultures when somebody leaves like New Orleans culture they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets
41,4,18/19,Pam, Do you mean leaves as in dies You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans funeral
42,4,18/19,Michael, If the Devil were to explode and evil were gone forever what sort of party would you have

46,4,18/19,Michael, Toga
47,4,18/19,Angela, You always do this We have a nice modest party planned and then you come in and demand the world Let me be clear There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides although Toby wont be in them
48,4,18/19,Michael, I thought that you might say that 
49,4,18/19,Michael, Every year my sweet sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars And lately she has been sending me like nine or ten checks a year uh as Nana starts to but I knew I should be saving it for something I just didnt know what I should be saving it for And then I had an awakening Michael buy a motorcycle So I put the money in my shoe and then I forgot about it until now
50,4,18/19,Michael, I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this ugly weight holding me down you know I want an antigravity machine I saw it in a movie You drink a potion and then you just start floating all around
51,4,18/19,Pam, So how much antigravity potion do you want
52,4,18/19,Angela, No No You know what This is not a partyplanning committee anymore And I dont want your foot money and I feel uncomfortable participating

50,5,6,Andy, Come on you think you can get into Cornell

52,5,6,Phyllis, Im sitting right here Dwight
53,5,6,Dwight, I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis as well as a slight to Andy
54,5,6,Dwight, Cornell is a good school and I want to better myself through higher education If it makes Andy angry so be it

76,5,6,Pete, Oh yeah

344,5,7,Jim, Im gonna make a bigger leap here He is into you
345,5,7,Alex, Why did you come to New York in the first place
346,5,7,Pam, Because they have a great design program and I wanted to see if I was any good at it And I wanted to work on my art too

348,5,7,Pam, Jims in Scranton
349,5,7,Alex, I know But all Im saying is if theres even a teeny tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist then I think you should stay here because you dont want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been And that is the end of my speech I planned it all Anyway  I will see you tomorrow

17,5,10,Michael, Ill be six
18,5,10,Oscar, And you ask them for money theyre gonna give you nine dollars Cause thats what they think it costs to run the stand So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand

97,5,11,Meredith, Obviously
98,5,11,Michael, Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church
99,5,11,Oscar, Where did you get this

112,5,11,Michael, Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night
113,5,11,Meredith, I am fine

128,5,11,Dwight, I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick
129,5,11,Dwight, There are several ways to kll a zombie but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick
130,5,11,Michael, Everyone in this room loves you but mark my words we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out

46,5,13,Dwight,  What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets
47,5,13,Michael, I will seduce her
48,5,13,Dwight, No I wanna seduce her
49,5,13,Michael, No I will seduce her
50,5,13,Dwight, Please Michael please
51,5,13,Michael, No I got it
52,5,13,Dwight, Youll fall in love with her
53,5,13,Michael, Yeah so what if I did That would take precedence and I would expect your support
54,5,13,Dwight, Okay lets go over the plan again
55,5,13,Michael, Alright I am a local business owner  I need to buy paper I find out everything about their prices and policies
56,5,13,Dwight, Your fictitious name
57,5,13,Michael, Michael Scarn
58,5,13,Dwight, I am a paper salesman looking for a new job I find out everything about their expenses and salaries
59,5,13,Michael, Okay
60,5,13,Dwight, Then we meet at the Dennys
61,5,13,Michael,  No
62,5,13,Dwight, and then we compare notes
63,5,13,Michael, No no I never said Dennys IHOP
64,5,13,Dwight, No 
65,5,13,Dwight, You know how I feel about IHOP
66,5,13,Michael, Oh dont start
67,5,13,Dwight, Are you socialist
68,5,13,Michael, You know what I dont want to get into this debate again I enjoy IHOP
69,5,13,Dwight, Ill have a cup of a coffee
70,5,13,Michael, You will have pancakes and youll like it
71,5,13,Dwight, Store only has three employees
72,5,13,Michael, So what
73,5,13,Dwight, It means they are not expanding
74,5,13,Michael, Maybe they are shrinking
75,5,13,Dwight, No
76,5,13,Michael, They could be shrinking
77,5,13,Dwight, No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store No sign of the sign being moved
78,5,13,Michael, Ah ha  Yup
79,5,13,Dwight,  Its lunch time and no sign of anyone coming in or out Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch
80,5,13,Michael, Mm hmm 
81,5,13,Dwight, Which Means theyre not acquiring new business So once again no growth
82,5,13,Michael, And there are clouds There are clouds in the sky which means gonna rain bad for business
83,5,13,Dwight, Oh it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus
84,5,13,Michael, Argh why are you all
85,5,13,Dwight, Get your clouds right
86,5,13,Michael, Shut up
87,5,13,Dwight, So you go in now I am going to go in exactly ten minutes We have never met each other We are complete strangers Also we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger Lick ur lips try it  No no like this  Good
88,5,13,Michael, Ready to do this
89,5,13,Dwight, Yeah
90,5,13,Michael, Good Here come the sharks 
91,5,13,Michael, In nature there is something called a food chain its where the shark eats a little shark And the little shark eats a littler shark And so on and so on Until you get down to the single cell shark So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business
92,5,13,Michael, Hello
93,5,13,Entire Prince family, Hello hi
94,5,13,Michael, My name is Michael Scarn I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company
95,5,13,Prince Grandfather, Oh please come in
96,5,13,Michael, Thank you
97,5,13,Prince Grandfather, What kind of business are you in
98,5,13,Michael, We are a law firm
99,5,13,Prince Grandfather, I assume your primary paper needs are stationary general office
100,5,13,Michael, You know I will be honest with you about something Where we used to live our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didnt feel like a priority So I guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have
101,5,13,Prince Grandfather, About 80
102,5,13,Michael, Really That many This doesnt seem like a very big operation
103,5,13,Prince Grandfather, Its just me my wife and my son
104,5,13,Michael, Ah so when did you set up shop
105,5,13,Prince Grandfather, I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam
106,5,13,Michael, Oh Vietnam I hear its lovely 
107,5,13,Prince Grandfather,  Mmhmm 
108,5,13,Andy, Hillary Swank is attractive
109,5,13,Entire office, Hot
110,5,13,Kevin, The debate is whether she is hot
111,5,13,Stanley, What difference does it make Attractive beautiful hot were talking about the same thing here
112,5,13,Kevin, Huge difference A painting can be beautiful but I dont want to bang a painting
113,5,13,Andy, Okay TMI
114,5,13,Michael, So even specialty paper say 94 brightness doublebonded you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock
115,5,13,Prince Grandfather, You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer
116,5,13,Michael, Well that is because I am a genius
117,5,13,Prince Grandfather, Oh really

126,5,13,Prince Grandfather, I sure hope not
127,5,13,Dwight, Me too 
128,5,13,Jim, I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures you know We dont really see them as real so therefore we dont judge them as real people
129,5,13,Kevin, Are you serious Jim just show us a picture
130,5,13,Oscar, Kevin cmon
131,5,13,Kelly, Yeah shut up Kevin
132,5,13,Kevin, Hes making all these fancy uh its a gut thing
133,5,13,Jim, Kevin you know what why dont you close your eyes Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you  and says Kevin Malone I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now And now you tell me something is she hot  Does that end the debate
134,5,13,Kevin,  No its is she hot not would you do her Respect the game
135,5,13,Angela, Oh my God

78,5,14/15,Michael, Electricity
79,5,14/15,Dwight, Shampoo
80,5,14/15,David Wallace, You could have burned down the whole building
81,5,14/15,Dwight, I just want to say for the record I did not kll anyone Stanley was attacked by his own heart And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days
82,5,14/15,Lawyer, Did you shout Fire causing a panic
83,5,14/15,Dwight, Yes I shouted fire I shouted many things I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what heeded

85,5,14/15,Dwight, When no one hedded
86,5,14/15,Michael, Take hedded of

100,5,14/15,David, Look this is very serious offense We have cause to fire you
101,5,14/15,Michel, Can you shove down Instead shove down please Instead what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer
102,5,14/15,Dwight, No
103,5,14/15,Michael, And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice Something that Dwight doesnt like
104,5,14/15,Dwight, PETA
105,5,14/15,David Wallace, Michael you have to take responsibility here One of your employees had a heart attack He could have died because of the way that you are allowing your office to run Do you want that on your conscious
106,5,14/15,Michael, Do you
107,5,14/15,David Wallace, Michael
108,5,14/15,Michael, You talking to me
109,5,14/15,David Wallace, Yeah
110,5,14/15,Michael, What
111,5,14/15,Dwight, Well I guess we papered over that pretty nicely  It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy highrise Whats the matter You hungry
112,5,14/15,Michael,  No Dwight I am worried A mans life is in my hands
113,5,14/15,Dwight, Dont you worry about that I got it covered Okay
114,5,14/15,Michael, Yeah

121,5,14/15,Dwight, Thats preposterous
122,5,14/15,Michael, No I will
123,5,14/15,Michael, Nobody should have to go to work thinking Oh this is the place that I might die today Thats what a hospital is for An office is for not dying An office is a place to live life to the fullest to the max to An office is a place where dreams come true
124,5,14/15,Michael, Shhh Dont excite him Dont make him excitable  Welcome back Stanley
125,5,14/15,Stanley, Thank you Michael
126,5,14/15,Stanley, Its true Around this office in the past I have been a little abrupt with people
127,5,14/15,Stanley,  Not maybe Yes or no
128,5,14/15,Stanley,  No way Uhuh
129,5,14/15,Stanley,  Are you from another planet

131,5,14/15,Stanley,  Did I stutter
132,5,14/15,Stanley,  Im done Goodbye
133,5,14/15,Stanley, But the doctor said if I cant find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings Im going to die
134,5,14/15,Michael, Andy
135,5,14/15,Andy,  A throne for your highness
136,5,14/15,Stanley, Im not sitting in a wheelchair
137,5,14/15,Michael, No no no No debate You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet
138,5,14/15,Stanley, Im going to die
139,5,14/15,CPR trainer, ABC Okay And hat stands for airway breathing and circulation
140,5,14/15,Michael, Okay you know what That could be a little confusing because in sales ABC means always be closing
141,5,14/15,Dwight, This is a farce I should be teaching this course
142,5,14/15,Michael, Shut it Shut it
143,5,14/15,Michael, We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his when his heart went berserk And I knew exactly what to do but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you cant get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it Red Cross you know racket
144,5,14/15,Kevin,  I cant keep doing this forever
145,5,14/15,CPR Trainer, Its been 20 seconds
146,5,14/15,Kevin, Call it
147,5,14/15,CPR Trainer, Would you like to try next
148,5,14/15,Dwight, Absolutely I would not
149,5,14/15,Michael, You know who I really think should go Stanley
150,5,14/15,Stanley, Oh I dont know
151,5,14/15,Phyllis, Thats not a good idea Michael
152,5,14/15,Michael, Come on
153,5,14/15,Phyllis, He needs to rest
154,5,14/15,Michael, No rest for the sick We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working What are you gonna do if youre by yourself and your heart stops
155,5,14/15,Stanley, I would die
156,5,14/15,Michael, And youre okay with that
157,5,14/15,Stanley, Im okay with the logic of it
158,5,14/15,Michael, Uhuh No no no Come on Get up Lets do this
159,5,14/15,Stanley, Yes I had a heart attack I would quit but Im too old to find another job and I dont have enough saved to retire I feel like Im working in my own casket
160,5,14/15,Michael, Come on Stanley Youre losing you Youre losing you Do it
161,5,14/15,Angela, Michael
162,5,14/15,Michael, This is you were talking about

164,5,14/15,Michael, Okay okay Ill show them Here we go  Stanley All right
165,5,14/15,CPR Trainer, So assessing the situation Are they breathing
166,5,14/15,Michael, No Rose They are not breathing And they have no arms or legs
167,5,14/15,Rose, No thats not part of it
168,5,14/15,Michael, Where are they You know what If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them I mean what kind of quality of life do we have there
169,5,14/15,Kevin, I would want to live with no legs
170,5,14/15,Michael, How about no arms No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now Kevin You dont do anything
171,5,14/15,Rose, All right well lets get back to it Cause youre losing him Okay too fast Everyone we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute 
172,5,14/15,Michael, okay thats uh hard to keep track How many is that per hour
173,5,14/15,Jim, Hows that gonna help you
174,5,14/15,Michael, I will divide and then count to it
175,5,14/15,Jim, Right
176,5,14/15,Rose, Okay Well a good trick is to pump to the tune of Staying Alive by the Bee Gees Do you know that song
177,5,14/15,Michael, Yes yes I do I love that song  First I was afraid I was petrified
178,5,14/15,Rose, No itsAh Ah Ah Ah stayin alive stayin alive

216,5,14/15,Dwight, Wow
217,5,14/15,Michael, Okay look David this is why we have training We start with the dummy and we learn from our mistakes And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person

309,5,14/15,Michael, Remember when people used to say boss when they were describing something that was really cool like those shoulder pads are really boss man Look at that perm that perm is so boss Its what made me want to become a boss And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads But now boss is just slang for jerk in charge
310,5,14/15,Michael, Ok everybody Ive figured it out The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think  You are keeping these feelings inside and that is whats causing stress So what is the solution Solution is honesty laughter and comedy In short

377,5,14/15,Pam, Dunder Mifflin this is Pam Uh Im sorry Michaels not here right now can I take a message Great I will Thanks
378,5,14/15,Dwight, Its very unusual for Michael not to show up to work My guess Hes either deeply depressed or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them And I always say Michael take two steps back and stare at the icicle from the side And hes like no I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them
379,5,14/15,Kevin,  He is so dumb that he tries to put his MMs in alphabetical order

392,5,14/15,Michael, You know sometimes to get perspective I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away And our problems dont matter to him because were just a distant point of light But he feels sorry for me because he has an incredibly powerful microscope and he can see my face  Im okay No Im not

403,5,14/15,Pam, Yeah 
404,5,14/15,Pam, When youre a kid you assume your parents are soul mates My kids are gonna be right about that I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them

54,5,19,Michael, The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had Its probably the best idea anybody has ever had Three days ago I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy and full of excitement and full of fantasy
55,5,19,Michael, Ive written these things because it is my responsibility as manager of this branch to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion Now it is your turn I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine  Umm hmm
56,5,19,Jim, We own our own delivery trucks We could lease them out on the weekends 
57,5,19,Michael, Too many words Good ideas are simple Golden ticket

66,5,19,Kevin, But I do like her just the way she is
67,5,19,Andy, Well thats not what we agreed on
68,5,19,Jim, What are you doing

70,5,19,Jim,  Why dont you just go out on a date with her Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two if it feels right youll know
71,5,19,Andy, No
72,5,19,Pam, You dont have to wait that long I mean you dont have to wait a month to ask her out Just ask her out
73,5,19,Andy, Youre asking him to give up all of his power
74,5,19,Jim, What power
75,5,19,Kevin, Andy Pam and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like Lynn I I dont like getting advice from more than one person at a time Im a textbook overthinker
76,5,19,Andy, You cant let a girl feel good about herself It will backfire on you Every compliment has to be backhanded Oh I like your dress but Id like it more if you had prettier hair

138,5,19,David, How could you not know Michael
139,5,19,Michael, I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant
140,5,19,David, Might have hi OK what firm
141,5,19,Michael, Youre breaking up
142,5,19,David, Michael
143,5,19,Michael, OK I think it might have been an inside consultant
144,5,19,David, Was it the sales department
145,5,19,Michael, Yes
146,5,19,David, Was it Jim
147,5,19,Michael, No

150,5,19,Michael,  Come on in Good to see ya have a seat I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea
151,5,19,Dwight, That was your idea
152,5,19,Michael, Woah wow who told you that
153,5,19,Dwight, You did Several times Over and over again
154,5,19,Michael,  No I dont think I ever did That was your idea Dwight
155,5,19,Dwight,  You were dressed as Willy Wonka so
156,5,19,Michael, Im not taking Im not taking
157,5,19,Dwight, Wasnt my idea Loved  but I cant
158,5,19,Michael, Wait a second wait a second I wrote it down in my diary
159,5,19,Dwight, You dont keep a diary
160,5,19,Michael, Yes I do Youve just never seen it  March 4th Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets
161,5,19,Dwight, Hold that thought   March 4th Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year
162,5,19,Michael, Why do you have a diary
163,5,19,Dwight, To keep secrets from my computer
164,5,19,Michael, OK you know what You came up with this idea I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up
165,5,19,Dwight, Impossible
166,5,19,Michael, Yes you did
167,5,19,Dwight, I wasnt given candy as a child so a movie that fetishized it that much would have made no sense to me Plus we werent allowed to see movies So do the math
168,5,19,Michael, What are you writing 
169,5,19,Dwight, Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasnt mine Discussed movies
170,5,19,Michael, Would you like to go to lunch with me Just the two of us
171,5,19,Dwight, With all my heart
172,5,19,Kevin, You guys are throwing a lot at me
173,5,19,Jim, All Im saying is that its a first dates so just keep a respectful distance
174,5,19,Kevin, Right
175,5,19,Pam, I dont think Jim means to say that you shouldnt touch her
176,5,19,Jim, No that is what I mean
177,5,19,Pam,  Shush  Kevin a playful touch on the arm or on the back it can show your interest and its really romantic
178,5,19,Kevin,  Like that
179,5,19,Jim, No stop it
180,5,19,Andy, Dont touch her Dont talk to her Dont look at her
181,5,19,Andy,  turn into this black and carbon brickwhere this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that
182,5,19,Michael, We think a lot alike Sometimes you will think something and I will say what youre thinking
183,5,19,Dwight, OK what am I thinking right now
184,5,19,Michael, Umm nacho chips
185,5,19,Dwight, No How skin is the largest organ of the body
186,5,19,Michael, Oh OK Let me just cut to the chase Dwight I want you to fall on your sword for me
187,5,19,Dwight, Oh not gonna happen
188,5,19,Dwight, I did fall on my sword once I was running with it in my belt Wont happen again
189,5,19,Michael, Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin I mean whats the point Youre cooped up in there all day You dont get to do your farming Youre not dating Angela anymore It doesnt matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea It doesnt matter Me on the other hand I would be lost without this place You way too manly
190,5,19,Dwight, What about Shoe La La
191,5,19,Michael,  Its not ready yet
192,5,19,Michael, I have an idea for a fancy mens shoe store called Shoe La La And its just mens shoes for the special occasions in a mans life like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby or for just lounging around the house
193,5,19,Michael, May I have your attention please I have an announcement Mr Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again I had fun I really had fun with my best friend Dwight
194,5,19,Oscar, These arent announcements
195,5,19,Michael, Yes they are you just dont care about the information
196,5,19,Dwight, I love working here and I do not want to leave
197,5,19,Michael, He doesnt love it that much Wouldnt be such a bad thing for him to be fired
198,5,19,Dwight, Well
199,5,19,Michael, I mean like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion
200,5,19,Dwight, We discussed the fact that Im cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world
201,5,19,Michael, Right
202,5,19,Dwight, No plowing my own acres Going around shirtless all day You know experiencing freedom
203,5,19,Michael, Thats it Thats it You cant put a price on freedom
204,5,19,Dwight, Try me
205,5,19,Michael, Thats why you made the decision Thats why you made
206,5,19,Dwight, I havent made a decision yet
207,5,19,Michael, You kind of have
208,5,19,Dwight, No
209,5,19,Michael, Yes
210,5,19,Jim, You cannot take the fall for him
211,5,19,Dwight, He said he would do the same for me
212,5,19,Jim, He can do the same for you Right now By getting fired instead of you So what are you gonna do
213,5,19,Dwight, Im gonna go back to work After I write you up for insubordination
214,5,19,Jim, There it is
215,5,19,Michael,  Oh my God Dwight Dwight Get in whats it gonna be what are you gonna do  Whats it gonna be Are you gonna do this thing for me Dwight  Hey David how are you Good to see you Nice surprise Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation
216,5,19,David, Thats too bad
217,5,19,Michael, Yes it is but it had to be done didnt it
218,5,19,David, Hopefully nothing that cant be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology The head of Blue Cross just called They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies Congratulations Dwight 
219,5,19,Dwight, David youre welcome 
220,5,19,David, I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr Dwight Schrute

238,5,20,Jim, Secondincommand to Michael
239,5,20,Charles, Oh I didnt know that position existed

241,5,20,Charles, So youre the assistant to the regional manager
242,5,20,Jim, Assistant regional manager yeah

249,5,20,Michael, Hello Stephanie Ok where is he 
250,5,20,David,  Michael
251,5,20,Michael,  So is this the meeting youve been in all day
252,5,20,David, How did you get here Michael
253,5,20,Michael, I drove
254,5,20,David, Ok
255,5,20,Michael, Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party Just pulled the rug out from under me And he said no figs Ive already bought em And I dont have a place to store them So I feel like Ive been sort of boned
256,5,20,David, Michael Listen
257,5,20,Michael, Do you talk to him about this Youve talked to him all day obviously Did you talk to him about this
258,5,20,David, Well I didnt know about the figs specifically  
259,5,20,Michael, Ok Then I dont get it It doesnt make any sense to me Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles and then Charles was supposed to talk to you and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again
260,5,20,David, Thats not exactly
261,5,20,Michael, Clearly thats what you wanted
262,5,20,David, No

262,5,24,Dwight, La la la Continuing Notice my persistence and recall Continuing You called Dunder Mifflin and your order was filled within an hour
263,5,24,Michael, Im going to pull a date out of the air right now April 13th 2002 That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs Is it not We all know that the economy is bad and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin
264,5,24,Dwight, Come on

274,5,24,Dwight, How is Tom the homosexual sophomore
275,5,24,Michael, I wanted to start a company not a wr Because in a wr you always fight those you are closest to And the great tragedy of the civil wr is that brother fought against brother For what What purpose did that serve Apart from abolishing slavery In that case wr was the right choice This doesnt feel as important though Thats just how the world works I guess

25,5,25,Charles, I dont know what to do to inspire these people Okay maybe its my fault

72,5,25,Financial Guy, Well if these numbers you gave me are correct
73,5,25,Michael, They are correct sir
74,5,25,Financial Guy, Then you cant afford to pay him anything
75,5,25,Michael, Okay A lame attempt at humor Swing and a miss
76,5,25,Financial Guy, Your prices are too low
77,5,25,Michael, Lowest in town
78,5,25,Financial Guy, Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin cant match your prices
79,5,25,Pam, Corporate greed
80,5,25,Ryan, Look our price model is fine I reviewed the numbers myself Over time with enough volume we become profitable
81,5,25,Financial Guy, Yeah with a fixed cost pricing model thats correct
82,5,25,Ryan, Yeah
83,5,25,Financial Guy, But you need to use a variable cost pricing model
84,5,25,Michael, Okay sure Right so why dont you explain what that is to so that they can under just explain what that is
85,5,25,Ryan, Explain what you think that is
86,5,25,Financial Guy, Okay
87,5,25,Michael, Explain that
88,5,25,Financial Guy, As you sell more paper and your company grows so will your costs For example delivery man health care

95,5,25,Michael, Okay okay Hold on hold on Ty I would like you to crunch those numbers again

101,5,25,Pam, When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree You dont blame the child He didnt know any better You blame the 30yearold woman who got in the passenger seat and said Drive kid I trust you

65,5,26,Dwight, Stop doing rhyming poetry Just tell them please God the simplest thing
66,5,26,Dwight, Were in crisis mode here do you understand The two unqualified socalled salespeople are being favored because they all failed together And frankly Im not convinced that Michael and Pam didnt have a thing going while they were gone
67,5,26,Jim, Can I address that
68,5,26,Dwight, No youre too close
69,5,26,Jim, Okay

78,5,26,Dwight, No Im not saying we do those things Im saying something like those things
79,5,26,Jim, Of course What is like a hostage

83,5,26,Jim, Stronglypainted picture
84,5,26,Dwight, No pictures are too interpretive
85,5,26,Jim, Can I just say something I know that tempers are high but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly

195,5,26,Dwight, Gasp Are you talking about a secret meeting

209,5,26,Stanley, Are you giving us our clients back
210,5,26,Michael, If we could just focus and go down the line and everyone would say apology accepted I think we would all feel better And then we can break out my gift to youcomplimentary white chocolate bark
211,5,26,Stanley, Nobody likes that stuff except for you
212,5,26,Michael, They wouldnt make it unless people liked it
213,5,26,Phyllis, Michael just give us our clients back Thats all we care about
214,5,26,Michael, Okay If I give you your clients back there wont be enough clients for Ryan and Pam and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople

216,5,26,Michael, Fine have your clients I can see thats what you wanted all along  However I rescind my apology
217,5,26,Dwight, Thats fair
218,5,26,Michael, You are not reacting at all as I had hoped
219,5,26,Darryl, Whatd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse
220,5,26,Ryan, Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople so now theres not enough for both me and Pam to stay on
221,5,26,Pam, He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now Hell make his decision by the end of the day
222,5,26,Ryan, I think you should get it You really grew into it
223,5,26,Pam, Oh I think you should get it Youve changed a lot and youd be good at it
224,5,26,Ryan, If you really think that will you tell that to Michael That would go a long way coming from you

252,5,26,Michael, I dont need to tell you that
253,5,26,Jim, I think shed be a really good salesperson

6,5,27,Michael,  Oh no I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing I actually dance all the time Tiptoeing around corporate  it is a ballet When I am breaking all the rules I am break dancing And expresso
7,5,27,Michael, Guys Im scared Im really scared I think Im growing into a giant Because look at this normal sized coffee cup Looks so tiny in my giant hand now Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on
8,5,27,Dwight, I do
9,5,27,Michael, Okay How about a woman Pam
10,5,27,Pam, Oh I cant do lunch I was just sending you an email Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor
11,5,27,Michael, Oh really Ok
12,5,27,Pam, Just sent it
13,5,27,Michael, What about the rest of you 
14,5,27,Michael, At DunderMifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I dont know who instituted it I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday So rules be damned I wanna have lunch with these people
15,5,27,Michael, Who else Who else Ryan
16,5,27,Ryan, I dont do lunch Im eating five small meals a day now
17,5,27,Ryan, Now that Im back to doing the job of a temp again I find that food is one thing I can control
18,5,27,Michael, Ok Anyone Anyone At all Accounting I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me
19,5,27,Angela, No I dont want to stay late to have a two hour lunch
20,5,27,Phyllis, Michael we have a lot of work to do
21,5,27,Michael, What
22,5,27,Phyllis, Work
23,5,27,Michael, Ugh God What happened to you people  We are just office drones We are office drones All we do is work is work
24,5,27,Pam, If you dont take out his battery he just keeps going all day

26,5,27,Michael,  I was just learning to love
27,5,27,Erin, Hi guys How you doing
28,5,27,Dwight, Erin how many times do I have to tell you It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us
29,5,27,Erin, Right Im sorry
30,5,27,Dwight,  Now how can I help you
31,5,27,Erin, Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown Ohio
32,5,27,Dwight, Attention office Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown Ohio I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something This location is the Superior Court 
33,5,27,Pam, So someone is going to a court Big deal
34,5,27,Dwight, It is a big deal Cause theres only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative To obtain a learners permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15 Erin let me see your birth certificate
35,5,27,Erin, Sure
36,5,27,Jim, There are other reasons to go to Ohio
37,5,27,Pam, Were getting married today
38,5,27,Jim, So it turns out its the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period
39,5,27,Pam, Tell em how it happened
40,5,27,Jim, Ok So were going through all the wedding plans and boy it is complicated
41,5,27,Pam, And very expensive
42,5,27,Jim, Very expensive Cause you say you want a small wedding and thats great but then you have to invite 
43,5,27,Pam, You cant leave anyone out
44,5,27,Jim, No one
45,5,27,Pam, Ok just get to the good part
46,5,27,Jim, Ok Right Oh so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said  You know what I want to do today I want to marry you
47,5,27,Pam, I had just woken up I didnt look cute Thats how I knew he meant it
48,5,27,Erin, Michael Michael sorry to bother you Are you going to be working down here Do you want these down here now
49,5,27,Michael, No work No work No work I come in here to release frustration Ooh Ah Ah Ah Ooh
50,5,27,Erin, Well I like to swim
51,5,27,Michael, Thats good
52,5,27,Erin, You have a cool place to come hang
53,5,27,Michael, If you ever want to come down here doors always open locks broken so
54,5,27,Erin, Thanks
55,5,27,Michael, Come on in Hey hey hey Here we go Here we go Yeah
56,5,27,Erin, Wow
57,5,27,Michael, Now you got it

59,5,27,Michael, Now you got it Hey you want some espresso
60,5,27,Erin, Oh yeah
61,5,27,Michael, You gotta keep yourself dehydrated
62,5,27,Erin, Thats rule 1
63,5,27,Michael, Ok I love it I love it
64,5,27,Erin, Whew
65,5,27,Michael, I love it
66,5,27,Michael, Guys I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts Theres no reason to be scared The bad man is goneCharles is gone
67,5,27,Michael, Charles really did a number on these guys They are way too focused on work When I was in charge this place was like Dave and Busters People just hanging out having fun eating apps I dont know Its like  Dave died or something
68,5,27,Michael, Daddys here and daddy is going to take care of you
69,5,27,Oscar, Please dont refer to yourself as our daddy
70,5,27,Michael, I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo
71,5,27,Andy,  Wittle Andy is afwaid
72,5,27,Michael, Andys afwaid
73,5,27,Andy, Yes
74,5,27,Michael, Are you all afwaid
75,5,27,Dwight, No
76,5,27,Michael, Daddys here for you My wittle angels Ok I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk
77,5,27,Pam, What
78,5,27,Michael, Funk is the problem and the solution
79,5,27,Jim, That makes sense
80,5,27,Michael, Ive taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together To meet To greet To see the ones that you love To love the ones that you see
81,5,27,Oscar, Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you
82,5,27,Michael, Why dont you get over lunch Oscar Everybody else is past it
83,5,27,Dwight,  All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy
84,5,27,Meredith, This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing
85,5,27,Michael, No Dwight is confusing you That  its its more of a disco
86,5,27,Andy, Its like a haunted disco
87,5,27,Michael,  with coffee but without the haunted
88,5,27,Phyllis, Its a combo dance house coffee bar
89,5,27,Michael, Its a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building
90,5,27,Erin, Its a cafe disco
91,5,27,Michael, Exactly
92,5,27,Kevin, So like a disco cafe

251,5,28,Nurse, Oh shouldnt be too bad its a slow day So no other radiation this year no metal plates no chance youre pregnant
252,5,28,Pam, Im sorry can we just hurry this up Ive got a game to get back to

254,5,28,Holly, Whatd you think
255,5,28,AJ, I loved it You know there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long but

258,5,28,Michael, Good to see you  AJ
259,5,28,AJ, Michael

139,6,1,Michael, Uh huh  Alright
140,6,1,Michael, How do you untell something You cant You cant put words back in your mouth What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything thats been said is untrue including Stanley is having an affair Its like the end of Spartacus Ive seen that movie half a dozen times and I still dont know who the real Spartacus is and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit
141,6,1,Erin, Kelly has an eating disorder

175,6,1,Oscar, Are you attracted to other men
176,6,1,Andy,  No But let me kick you a scenario Im at a beach cabana and Brad Pitt approaches He tries to lean in and kiss me I would definitely resist like at first But if he was persistent  I think I might give in a little bit just to see what it felt like
177,6,1,Oscar, 
178,6,1,Andy, Would I push him away How hard Like what if hes like really aggressive
179,6,1,Oscar, If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit he would still need to get to you
180,6,1,Andy, Its not real Brad Pitt this is like this is my fantasy Or its like not a fantasy its just its just a scenario
181,6,1,Oscar, Wow I wish I wish I could help you I dont you might be gay You might be gay
182,6,1,Oscar, What exactly is my responsibility here To comfort insecure heterosexual men That cant possibly fall to me

232,6,1,Toby,  What are you guys talking about I have a daughter How can I be a virgin
233,6,1,Jim, Hey has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today
234,6,1,Everyone,  Yes
235,6,1,Michael,  Yeah yeah you know what Lets discredit these rumors
236,6,1,Jim, Yeah sure but whos been saying all that stuff
237,6,1,Michael, Thats not important Jim I just think we shouldnt listen to any of that crap
238,6,1,Pam, Sure but we should get to the bottom of this Lets pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning
239,6,1,Kevin, I need to do mine first Whos been saying that theres another person inside of me working me with controls
240,6,1,Creed, I heard that from Andy
241,6,1,Andy, I heard it from Erin
242,6,1,Erin, I heard it from Michael
243,6,1,Michael, 
244,6,1,Pam,  Michael  Hes over here
245,6,1,Pam,  Where are you going
246,6,1,Michael, Nowhere

262,6,1,Angela, No We heard that about Jim
263,6,1,Michael, Jim No no I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J Crew model and I was referring to myself
264,6,1,Angela, How is that a bad rumor
265,6,1,Michael, Because a lot of people think that models even though theyre very attractive are somewhat vapid Its set our industry back quite a bit
266,6,1,Oscar, Michael why Why say all these things Why make up an eating disorder Stanleys affair me being a spokesdog
267,6,1,Stanley,  You told everyone I was having an affair
268,6,1,Michael, Okay okay heres the thing There was one true rumor out there today I didnt want everybody to know what it was So all of you are off the hook except for this one person

278,6,1,Erin, Thats really great you guys
279,6,1,Ryan, Dont vaccinate it

297,6,1,Pam,  Its clear why we were trying not to tell people Thats clear now 
298,6,1,Michael,  How long have you known about the pregnancy
299,6,1,Jim & Pam, 
300,6,1,Michael, A week A month A year
301,6,1,Jim, Michael we only told our parents last week
302,6,1,Michael, Did you pee on a stick
303,6,1,Jim, I did It was inconclusive
304,6,1,Michael, You shouldve told me
305,6,1,Pam,  Youre right We shouldve realized that you are an equal part of this
306,6,1,Michael, 
307,6,1,Erin, Michael Teri Hudson returning your call
308,6,1,Michael, 
309,6,1,Pam,  You called Stanleys wife
310,6,1,Michael, Oh oh yeah a long time ago just to make sure she was out of town Oh oh God
311,6,1,Jim, Dont take it
312,6,1,Michael, No I have to take it or itll seem suspicious
313,6,1,Pam, If you talk to her youre gonna tell her about Stanley and thats gonna seem more suspicious
314,6,1,Michael, No no I can do this
315,6,1,Jim, You cant do this
316,6,1,Michael, Yes I can I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo and I need her help We will haggle about money and then I will back down and then I wont talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over
317,6,1,Jim, That sounds terrible
318,6,1,Pam, Michael please dont
319,6,1,Michael,  Hey what up Cynthia 
320,6,1,Jim, 
321,6,1,Michael, Hold on a second Cynthia
322,6,1,Jim, 
323,6,1,Michael, Well it turns out that Teri was already suspicious because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago So Stanley promised that he would stop and he did end of story Well not exactly  Uhh Cynthia kept calling him she would not stop calling him and she was in love with him Oh and get this Cynthia also married So you cant stop love I guess  and quite frankly I dont think you should ever try
324,6,1,Maurie,  I learned that a company can describe their internship as full of exciting experiences even if thats a lie Theres no regulation

81,6,2,Kelly, Is Ryan going
82,6,2,Pam, I dont know he hasnt RSVPd yet
83,6,2,Pam, We invited everyone in the office to our wedding Even though we realized most people wouldnt be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls  Which is why were having it in Niagara Falls  Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off if they came So now people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work
84,6,2,Kelly, Heres the deal I really want to go but Im not gonna go if Ryan doesnt go because its kind of a waste of time That came out wrong It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because Id really like to be there to support Jim
85,6,2,Andy, What can I do for ya Hoss
86,6,2,Michael,  How are your sales doin
87,6,2,Andy, How are my sales doin Busted My numbers are down a little bit and its cause of the economy Youre not buying it youre good Okay the truth is I have been having trouble focusing lately Im in this weird flirty nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and its a total mind effer

89,6,2,Andy, Oh Im sorry Phyllis you explain this email okay Hey Andy lets go visit grandma and then get drunk together ha ha
90,6,2,Michael, Shhh Im just trying to figure out whats going on in that room okay
91,6,2,Michael, Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that Im completely overwhelmed
92,6,2,Michael, You know when they say its so crazy it just might work Well I dont believe that I say go for the airtight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart It is just elegant
93,6,2,Michael,  Be my eyes
94,6,2,Andy, You got it
95,6,2,Stanley, What have we here
96,6,2,Andy, Oh just backing up and turning around
97,6,2,Kevin, Hey were gonna do this
98,6,2,Andy, Dit dit dit dit its not for you  Pardon moi Messieurs I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room
99,6,2,David, Cheese platter
100,6,2,Andy, Oui Oui Monsieur From the Wisconsin region a nice firm cheddar Also from the great state of Wisconsin an aged parmesan Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think youll find both challenging and delicious At that point I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing If I may be so bold its a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese Bon appetit
101,6,2,David, Alright well I should go Thanks for this Youve given me a lot to think about Please promise me you wont do anything until we speak
102,6,2,Jim, No I wont Alright thanks for giving me your time I appreciate it

113,6,2,Toby, Wow
114,6,2,Dwight, Im rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house
115,6,2,Toby, Thats so cool
116,6,2,Dwight, Yeah
117,6,2,Toby, Wow Id love to take a look at that
118,6,2,Dwight, Yeah its just a run of the mill slaughter house but sure anytime
119,6,2,Toby, Well you know cause of the trains
120,6,2,Dwight, Wa wa wait  someones coming

126,6,2,Dwight, Toby
127,6,2,Toby, You gonna eat all that dog food yourself
128,6,2,Dwight, Ooohhh  Oh man You okay
129,6,2,Toby, Just keep going
130,6,2,Pam, Hey Ryan
131,6,2,Ryan, Hey
132,6,2,Pam, So I just wanted to confirm that youre not coming to my wedding
133,6,2,Ryan, Yeah I might stop by
134,6,2,Pam, It costs about 75 per person
135,6,2,Ryan, Okay I once had a glass of Cognac that cost 77
136,6,2,Pam, Can you just tell me now if youre coming or not
137,6,2,Ryan, Yes Im coming to your wedding
138,6,2,Pam, Okay Ryan Howard yes
139,6,2,Ryan, Probably yes
140,6,2,Pam, Kelly Kapoor yes
141,6,2,David, Are you sure youre okay with these new responsibilites
142,6,2,Michael, Look who youre talking to
143,6,2,David, Im just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyones talents
144,6,2,Michael, Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man woman or child to have ever run this branch ever
145,6,2,David, What about Jim Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position
146,6,2,Michael,  Permission to speak on the record
147,6,2,David, Please do
148,6,2,Michael, Jim is like Big Bird He is tall and yellow and very nice But would I put him in charge No I dont think so Because Big Bird doesnt make the tough decisions I If I was gonna put someone in charge I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grownups in charge like Maria or Gordon maybe
149,6,2,David, I thought you liked Jim
150,6,2,Michael, Very much Jim is my best friend But its his performance report right here Now this was written by Toby who we all know is extremely reliable
151,6,2,David,  Constant office distractions spends way too much time at reception antagonizes other salesman not at all what he thinks he is
152,6,2,Michael, Its not very well written but you get the gist
153,6,2,David, Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch
154,6,2,Michael, I can just continue to run it myself
155,6,2,David, Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position
156,6,2,Michael, This was Jims idea
157,6,2,David, Mmhmm
158,6,2,Michael, Wow Ummm well Id have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block
159,6,2,David, Ummm okay heres the thing though The plan doesnt work unless we have someone to replace you I was hoping plus we have to worry about Jim he has another job offer We may have to replace him
160,6,2,Jim, I didnt tell Michael because I thought hed try to help Example he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon
161,6,2,David, Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second
162,6,2,Jim, Sure
163,6,2,Michael,  I cant help but feel partially responsible
164,6,2,Michael,  Little pick me up  Oh those are the best Little sugar rush
165,6,2,Jim, When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace did I come up at all
166,6,2,Michael, Well we did talk about how handsome you are
167,6,2,Jim, Why dont we head in your office to talk
168,6,2,Michael, Oh what a week God We said I know there were certain things we said
169,6,2,Jim, Michael look Ill just be honest with you Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion I actually think that talk went really well And then after he spoke with you for some reason it felt like things had changed
170,6,2,Michael, Hmmm thats weird thats weird its kinda weirding me out Did you know that Lincolns secretary was named Kennedy
171,6,2,Jim, Michael did you say anything
172,6,2,Michael, Tell you what when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion
173,6,2,Jim, Really
174,6,2,Michael, Yes
175,6,2,Jim, You will Wanna do it right now
176,6,2,Michael, Yes
177,6,2,Jim, I tried to keep Michael in the dark I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark
178,6,2,Dwight, I need to see your pupils I need to see if theyre dilated
179,6,2,Toby, If they were dilated
180,6,2,Darryl, Toby Dwight Is that them
181,6,2,Gwenneth, Definitely
182,6,2,Darryl, You come to my house bust up my trash cans call my baby sister an ass and told her to eat dog food
183,6,2,Dwight, We thought that she was you
184,6,2,Darryl, Why would you think a lady is me
185,6,2,Dwight, Are you are you serious Be cause you look exactly alike Am I the only one Are you getting this
186,6,2,Toby, No nah I dont see it
187,6,2,Darryl, Heres what Im gonna do Im calling corporate and Im filing a complaint against both of you
188,6,2,Dwight, Aww Darryl
189,6,2,Darryl, Cmon Gwenneth
190,6,2,Gwenneth, Sad

192,6,2,Michael, Hey David this is Michael Scott  Michael Scott here
193,6,2,David, Yep
194,6,2,Michael, Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert I understand that he did not receive the promotion And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction
195,6,2,David, So what youre changing your mind about Jim
196,6,2,Michael , Absolutely  not  Like I said before Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job
197,6,2,David, Michael it seems like youre cutting in and out This is not what you said earlier
198,6,2,Michael, Wha heres the thing Jim is the best man for this job I think you should give it to him
199,6,2,David, Well it doesnt change what you showed me in Jims file
200,6,2,Michael, Well nnnn that that was an anomaly That file had been falsified Toby Flenderson is doing drugs
201,6,2,David, Michael I really dont know whats going on  down there but oh dammit I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell dammit
202,6,2,Toby, Hey Darryl look ahhh were here to apologize ahh
203,6,2,Darryl, Cool
204,6,2,Dwight, Wait Theyre using the lift as their own personal elevator
205,6,2,Toby, What
206,6,2,Dwight, He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment case closed
207,6,2,Darryl, Stupidest thing Ive ever heard
208,6,2,Dwight, Really Then why is there new wood only on one railing Hmmm We should check the security tapes Toby
209,6,2,Toby, Well I dont think theres any reason to check em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain
210,6,2,Darryl, Alright yeah fine so whatever
211,6,2,Dwight, Yes
212,6,2,Toby, You really did it
213,6,2,Dwight, Now I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form
214,6,2,Darryl, And Im telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister
215,6,2,Dwight, Phhhht No judge is gonna believe that
216,6,2,Toby, Ahhh kay Look we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork but you know we can just move on with our with our lives
217,6,2,Toby, So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork We worked it out
218,6,2,Michael, Hey hey Jim it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face Alright Just do it
219,6,2,Jim, How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job
220,6,2,Michael, I never recommended you because I didnt want to lose you and I didnt want to lose Pam  and now I dont wanna lose the baby
221,6,2,Jim, So instead you screwed me
222,6,2,Michael, Thats what she
223,6,2,Jim, No

235,6,2,Michael, Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager
236,6,2,David, We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton Both of you guys working as comanagers Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff
237,6,2,Jim, Wow that sounds pretty cool
238,6,2,Michael, I like that so manager and comanager
239,6,2,David, Comanager and Comanager See there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs
240,6,2,Michael, Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager
241,6,2,David, Alright hey Michael can you pick up for one second  Okay look Im not going to force you into anything If youre willing to lose Jim fine you just say so and well find another solution okay Is that what you want to do

34,6,3,Dwight, I deserved that promotion not Jim Oh man Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock And hes gasping hes panting Every last breath And the crowd is going crazy And boom I emerge victorious  Aha 18000 and a chance at the title Ooh hah
35,6,3,Erin,  Dwight Jim wants you to keep it down
36,6,3,Michael, Everyone now would be a good time to freshen up because Id like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes And I suggest that you bring a snack because we may be in there for a while
37,6,3,Jim, Michael
38,6,3,Michael, Yes
39,6,3,Jim, Can I talk to you in my office for a second
40,6,3,Michael, Mmm sure but could I first talk to you in my office
41,6,3,Stanley, Can I also be a boss
42,6,3,Oscar, Look it doesnt take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders Go ahead name a country that doesnt have two presidents A boat that sets sail without two captains Where would Catholicism be without the popes
43,6,3,Jim, I have noticed that we
44,6,3,Michael, Welcome
45,6,3,Jim, Thank you Ive noticed weve been having a lot of conference room meetings
46,6,3,Michael, Mmhmm
47,6,3,Jim, And Im wondEring if perhaps those are a bit um
48,6,3,Michael, Disruptive
49,6,3,Jim, Yes
50,6,3,Michael, No I dont think they are I think the meetings are very important
51,6,3,Jim, Okay maybe we should talk specifics
52,6,3,Michael, Lets do
53,6,3,Jim, Okay Yesterday we had a meeting about planets
54,6,3,Michael, N well to be fair Jim James Jimothy To be fair Jimothy the ah that sounds weird Are you okay with being called Jim
55,6,3,Jim, I am
56,6,3,Michael, Alright Jim to be fair the conversation wasnt about planets
57,6,3,Jim, Right
58,6,3,Michael, At first we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon So you draw a line from there to the other planets and I think by the end we all learned a little bit about how small we are
59,6,3,Jim, Yes I agree
60,6,3,Michael, Because its a big universe and were all just little tiny specks of dust
61,6,3,Jim, I just think that maybe theyre eating large amounts of the day
62,6,3,Michael, You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps You go to sleep its light out you wake up its dark Thats the whole day Where did that day go I have no idea
63,6,3,Jim, You mean on a weekend
64,6,3,Michael, Yes
65,6,3,Jim, How about this I think our goal should be we dont have meetings unless theyre absolutely essential
66,6,3,Michael, Alright No more meetings this week
67,6,3,Jim, Really You just agreed to that
68,6,3,Michael, I can be very suprising
69,6,3,Phyllis, Whats going on
70,6,3,Pam, I need to fit into my wedding dress However Im also pregnant
71,6,3,Ryan, You know its a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy Look at these actresses Some of them lose weight
72,6,3,Phyllis, Hey did you guys register for wedding gifts
73,6,3,Pam, We did but mostly because people expect us to Were also accepting other gifts not on the registry However much
74,6,3,Pam, Its awkward asking people for money but we could really use it Why doesnt Crate  Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash
75,6,3,Phyllis, Perfect I hate registries
76,6,3,Pam, Oh good
77,6,3,Phyllis, My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes I know I shouldnt tell you but youll still be suprised when you see it Youre not registered for a birdhouse are you
78,6,3,Pam, No were not
79,6,3,Phyllis, Good Good
80,6,3,Michael, Mmhmm
81,6,3,Jim,  Okay I thought I saw people missing
82,6,3,Michael, Yeah just focusgrouping a product expansion idea to these folks Got one of each
83,6,3,Jim, Really Hey Stanley what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door
84,6,3,Michael, Stanley you dont need to answer that
85,6,3,Jim, Stanley
86,6,3,Stanley, If you dont smell this youre fired
87,6,3,Jim, Okay Michael I thought we agreed to not take up peoples time with meetings like these
88,6,3,Michael, What do you mean by these people
89,6,3,Jim, Michael this is a conference room meeting
90,6,3,Michael, Oh hey everybody I think that Jim has gone insane because he thinks that my office is a conference room
91,6,3,Jim, Thats not what I meant
92,6,3,Michael, Listen Jim no offense but when push comes to shove what I want is more important that what you want
93,6,3,Jim, I disagree
94,6,3,Michael, What do you guys think 
95,6,3,Jim, Great Guys can I just have a moment alone with Michael
96,6,3,Michael, No no no you dont need to go anywhere Anything that Jim has to say to me he can say in front of these types of people
97,6,3,Jim, That is not what I said and also I am comanager meaning you are not the only manager anymore I am also I comanager
98,6,3,Michael, That is not what Wallace told us
99,6,3,Jim, Thats exactly what Wallace told us
100,6,3,Michael, That is not the way I heard it
101,6,3,Kelly, I love rivalries Michael or Jim Paris or Nicole Heidi or LC Its so much fun But I guess if Im really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly Id have to go with LC Heidis a bad friend and her skin is terrible
102,6,3,Michael, It is one thing me giving you the comanager title It is another thing you bossing me around
103,6,3,Jim, Im not bossing you around Im trying to do my job which is sharing your job so maybe we should just call David Wallace
104,6,3,Michael, No no no No we will not call David Wallace  I will call David Wallace
105,6,3,Erin, David Wallace is on line two for you guys
106,6,3,Michael, Or David Wallace will call us on line two Why dont we just
107,6,3,Jim, Hey David You got Jim here
108,6,3,Michael, Hey David this is Michael senior comanager
109,6,3,David Wallace, Hey guys um Im calling because unfortunately we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year and I know people expect it However there just is only a small amount of money for each branch so were leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it
110,6,3,Michael, Got it Dave Sounds like your classice bigpicture decision
111,6,3,Jim, Which will clearly affect the daytoday wellbeing of our employees
112,6,3,David Wallace, Its probably a little of both
113,6,3,Michael, Which is it more of
114,6,3,David Wallace, Excuse me
115,6,3,Jim, David I know that Im very new at this but I have a very good perspective on how things work
116,6,3,David Wallace, Wait Im sorry Michael are you are you texting me
117,6,3,Michael, I thought maybe we could talk after this is over
118,6,3,David Wallace, Look I need you both to take care of this This is not going to be a problem is it
119,6,3,Jim, Nope not at all
120,6,3,Michael, No it will not be I am on top of it
121,6,3,David Wallace, Very good
122,6,3,Jim, Alright thanks alot David
123,6,3,Michael, Talk to you later  Okay you didnt let me say goodbye  Alright I am looking forward to this
124,6,3,Jim, You dont have to lie
125,6,3,Michael, I hate the fact that we have to do this together I think we work better separately When I am irritated and I look at you I dont see you anymore
126,6,3,Jim, Right
127,6,3,Michael, All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are
128,6,3,Jim, Alright Lets get started
129,6,3,Creed, Hey why havent we ever um
130,6,3,Meredith, We have
131,6,3,Michael, You know theres no easy way to do this I say we add 15 to their paychecks and dont say anything about it
132,6,3,Jim, Do you mean like breakin in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll
133,6,3,Michael, No we can do it during the day It doesnt have to be that dramatic Jim
134,6,3,Jim, Okay You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options
135,6,3,Michael, Jim dont take this the wrong way Are you gonna take this the wrong way
136,6,3,Jim, Its hard to tell so far
137,6,3,Michael, You use your brain too much
138,6,3,Jim, Im sorry are you advocating that I use it less
139,6,3,Michael, Sometimes the smartest people dont think at all
140,6,3,Jim, You just came up with that
141,6,3,Michael, As I was saying it
142,6,3,Jim, Yeah Okay so for the 15 increase pro everyone gets a little bit
143,6,3,Michael,  Con you look like a nerd
144,6,3,Jim, Con no one gets as much as they did last year
145,6,3,Michael, Pro you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds
146,6,3,Jim, Pro no favoritism
147,6,3,Michael, Con you unzip your pants and you find that theres a calculator down there
148,6,3,Jim, Ive been studying Michael for years and Ive condensed what Ive learned into this chart  How Michael spends his time As you can see we have procrastinating and distracting others and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking I made it bigger so that you could see it
149,6,3,Kevin, Hey Pam I heard that you were registered but I didnt hear where
150,6,3,Pam, I dont think we registered anywhere We just want cash

156,6,3,Pam, Okay
157,6,3,Kevin, Wait til Monday
158,6,3,Pam, Is this what Ive become Materialistic Shallow I feel horrible  oh look Mrs Pam Halpert Thats the first time Ive seen it in writing
159,6,3,Jim, You know the more I think about it the more I think we should give it to the salesmen
160,6,3,Michael, That will not go over well
161,6,3,Jim, I know I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now Course I know that this might come off as biased so you know what Let us
162,6,3,Michael, Oh my God Are you gonna make another pro and con list Im gonna kll myself
163,6,3,Jim, Im not gonna let you stop me from thinking
164,6,3,Michael, No I could not do that Jim I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect If I can just think this through if I could just think it exactly right I can make this perfect and then I can go down every avenue and every avenue off of that avenue and then another avenue
165,6,3,Jim, Michael
166,6,3,Michael, And then another
167,6,3,Jim, Look you have a lot of strengths
168,6,3,Michael, Oh I do Tell me what they are
169,6,3,Jim, I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well
170,6,3,Michael, Ha That I am not known for that
171,6,3,Jim, But there is a reason why Im here
172,6,3,Michael, Yes You went over my head to Wallace
173,6,3,Jim, No its because you also have a lot of weaknesses Michael
174,6,3,Michael, Okay Well why dont you tell me what those are Jim Why dont you enliven me
175,6,3,Jim, I dont think youre good at making tough decisions
176,6,3,Michael, Ah
177,6,3,Jim, At thinking out the options and then stating that decision very clearly especially when its an unpopular decision
178,6,3,Michael, Okay heres a tough decision for you You suck You suck Is that clear enough for you
179,6,3,Jim, But maybe Im here for a reason because I might have some good ideas too Ive been sitting out there and Ive been learning a lot and maybe I can just bring something different to the table
180,6,3,Michael, Okay Skippy here we go Why dont you run yourself out there and tell them  You call it
181,6,3,Jim, 
182,6,3,Michael,  This had better be terrible
183,6,3,Jim, Could I have everyones attention please I have some tough news so Im just gonna give it to you straight Truth is we only have so much money for raises this year so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people wont Now what weve decided is we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff
184,6,3,Meredith, Wait Seriously
185,6,3,Jim, Look you guys are smart so Im just leveling with you Im just trying to treat you like adults
186,6,3,Oscar, Thank you Jim for thinking that were smart people
187,6,3,Angela, But I do not understand If were such smart adults then why dont we get raises
188,6,3,Oscar, Excellent question genius Its because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with
189,6,3,Jim, Ooh easy Thats not it at all
190,6,3,Oscar, Well
191,6,3,Jim, Really what it is is about the money the sales staff brings into the office
192,6,3,Kelly,  Whats going on
193,6,3,Kevin, Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen
194,6,3,Kelly, What the hell Why are you being such a jerk
195,6,3,Oscar, Hold on Kelly Would it help you to know that Jim thinks youre smart
196,6,3,Kelly, No  How is that gonna repair Ryans car
197,6,3,Dwight, This is ridiculous How could he do this to us
198,6,3,Jim, Okay Dwight you know what Youd be getting the raise so
199,6,3,Dwight, What about all these people huh How is it fair to them
200,6,3,Oscar, Exactly
201,6,3,Kevin, Totally
202,6,3,Oscar, We work just as hard as the sales people We deserve raises
203,6,3,Creed, Yes
204,6,3,Angela, Yes They dont get em if we dont get em
205,6,3,Meredith, My kid needs shoes You want to tell him he doesnt get shoes
206,6,3,Kevin, Yeah
207,6,3,Dwight, Her kid needs shoes Jim
208,6,3,Meredith, What the hell 
209,6,3,Jim, Wow Im just gonna rewind and back off a bit so 
210,6,3,Michael, That was good That was good Okay all right Well we all know its hard to be a boss right You know what Look around you These are your best friends These are the people who will open their hearts to you They all have heartons for you  and that is a gift So in terms of gifts we should be giving each other gifts Angela yes lend Oscar a cup of sugar This
211,6,3,Angela, What are you talking about Michael
212,6,3,Stanley, We just need to hear your plan for our raise
213,6,3,Michael, My plan a man panama
214,6,3,Andy, Thats not how that goes
215,6,3,Meredith, Youre not saying anything At least Jim was being direct
216,6,3,Jim, Thank you Meredith
217,6,3,Meredith, when he was telling us his dumbass plan
218,6,3,Oscar, We would just like to know whats happening Are we getting a raise yes or no
219,6,3,Michael, Alright Let me get this clear Does everybody want a raise  Alright everyone wants a raise so what were going to do is go into here and we will not come out until we do
220,6,3,Oscar, Again that gives us no information
221,6,3,Phyllis, This isnt a game you know Its our livelihood
222,6,3,Michael, What about a raise based on merit
223,6,3,Jim, Rank each person individually
224,6,3,Michael, Mmhmm Piece of cake Ryan obviously the best
225,6,3,Jim,  Well obviously Too bad hes a temp and doesnt count so lets get started 
226,6,3,Michael, Are you making a
227,6,3,Jim, Nope Im numbering the paper
228,6,3,Oscar,  Just
229,6,3,Kevin, Yeah I dont understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us
230,6,3,Angela, Its not like were not gonna see the checks Were in accounting
231,6,3,Meredith, I am so pissed at this company
232,6,3,Dwight,  And Jim
233,6,3,Meredith, Yeah Who said that
234,6,3,Dwight, I think it was Creed
235,6,3,Creed, Yep
236,6,3,Jim,  Its going really well actually
237,6,3,Jim,  Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise We each got 24 beans so the idea is you place the bean on the picture  of who you think deserv whos that 
238,6,3,Michael, Toby
239,6,3,Jim, Hes not a part of this You know that
240,6,3,Michael, Just wanted to draw a picture of him
241,6,3,Jim, Okay your move
242,6,3,Michael, Alright Who to pick  Who to pick
243,6,3,Jim, Here we go
244,6,3,Michael, I will skip a turn
245,6,3,Jim, Okay youre gonna still have to play that bean You know that
246,6,3,Michael, I need more time
247,6,3,Erin, Wallace sent an email about a meeting next week He wants you both to respond 
248,6,3,Dwight, People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is Its great Eventually theyll rise up and revolt My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later If the people here were our founding fathers the Revolutionary wr would have been delayed ten years because Stanley Washington was napping and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly
249,6,3,Dwight, Come on in  Thats right Come in feast your eyes They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces
250,6,3,Oscar, What the hell
251,6,3,Dwight, Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager
252,6,3,Michael, Hey what are you guys doing in here
253,6,3,Kevin, What does a bean mean
254,6,3,Pam, Why arent there any beans on this very old frizzyhaired picture of me
255,6,3,Kevin, Michael what does a bean mean
256,6,3,Pam, Jim
257,6,3,Jim, I was just trying to be unbiased
258,6,3,Kevin, What does a bean mean
259,6,3,Oscar, Someone please explain it to Kevin
260,6,3,Meredith, Why cant you My time is just as valuable as yours
261,6,3,Phyllis, Not according to the beans
262,6,3,Angela, This is how you make this important decision
263,6,3,Andy, Theres no way that Stanley gets more beans than me  That is ridiculous This is how it works 
264,6,3,Phyllis, Its not so much that I might not get a raise Its just demeaning
265,6,3,Andy, Thank you That is exactly by the way I would also like a raise
266,6,3,Phyllis, Yeah I would too
267,6,3,Dwight, Are we idiots  What right does Jim have to claim authority hmm Is he as good a salesman as I Is he as matronly as Phyllis There are moments where we can affect change For a few seconds every decade we exist and these are those seconds Let us storm his castle Come on Tick lets get him Tock lets get Jim Tick and drag Jim out of his office Tock take his keys away from him Tick thats a clock The time is getting very close Its now or never What say you
268,6,3,Phyllis, I say no
269,6,3,Dwight, No I mean what do you say to my plan  Okay
270,6,3,Michael, 
271,6,3,Kevin, What does a bean mean
272,6,3,Michael,  How you doing
273,6,3,Jim, Uh on a scale of one to ten Id say Im about a four
274,6,3,Michael, Oh what are you usually
275,6,3,Jim, Six You
276,6,3,Michael, Usually a ten but Im feeling like a zero
277,6,3,Jim, I mean a performancebased raise sounded like a good idea right
278,6,3,Michael, I know I know
279,6,3,Jim, We tried to find the fairest way to do it
280,6,3,Michael, Yes we did
281,6,3,Jim, I just what
282,6,3,Michael, Um nothing I just I used to have to do this part alone and it was the worst I have something I would like to give you 
283,6,3,Phyllis, Michael
284,6,3,Kevin, Michael
285,6,3,Phyllis, Come on This isnt fair
286,6,3,Jim,  Michaels my only friend left in the office Except Pam I think Is she still upset
287,6,3,Phyllis,  Michael you cannot just keep avoiding us like this
288,6,3,Jim,  Thank you
289,6,3,Michael, Youre welcome
290,6,3,Jim, Whats in here
291,6,3,Michael, Gin 
292,6,3,Jim, Ooh
293,6,3,Michael,  Just pretend were not here
294,6,3,Ryan, Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding
295,6,3,Pam, Yeah I mean if its all the same for you
296,6,3,Ryan, Question for you Would you guys rather have 100 now or 5000 a year from now
297,6,3,Pam, 100 now for sure
298,6,3,Ryan, Because you just give me 50 to cover the broker fee I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift
299,6,3,Pam, Yeah No no Ill um the hundred Ill just take the hundred
300,6,3,Ryan, Instead of 5000 a year from now
301,6,3,Pam, How sure is this
302,6,3,Pam, The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game
303,6,3,Pam,  Dont tell Jim
0,6,5-Apr,Pam, Im sorry You guys have probably noticed my stomachs a little more sensitive lately So if you wouldnt mind wearing a little less perfume and if your lunch is especially pungent maybe have it in the break room
1,6,5-Apr,Jim, We would really appreciate it
2,6,5-Apr,Dwight, Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy If she eats something the fetus doesnt like she is screwed Its amazing A three ounce fetus is calling the shots Its so bad ass
3,6,5-Apr,Pam, Phyllis if you could switch to a different soap just for a month or two Yours is kind of perfumy
4,6,5-Apr,Phyllis, Now this is getting ridiculous
5,6,5-Apr,Dwight, Oh gee Im sorry I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant No I reserve the right to peel my hardboiled eggs at my desk
6,6,5-Apr,Meredith, All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and Im not stopping for anyone
7,6,5-Apr,Pam, I dont think Im asking for too much I guess its just the end of courtesy in the workplace
8,6,5-Apr,Andy,  Watching people get sick always makes me sick And frankly so does talking about it So wow 
9,6,5-Apr,Michael,  What do you think I spent all morning on it
10,6,5-Apr,Jim, It is really special
11,6,5-Apr,Pam, Yeah but arent you supposed to do that to our no Its great

20,6,5-Apr,Dwight, Come on Youve got to be kidding me
21,6,5-Apr,Pam, Ok All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding
22,6,5-Apr,Jim, Absolutely Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended
23,6,5-Apr,Angela, Decent people everywhere will get offended
24,6,5-Apr,Pam, Well were thinking of my grandmother who we havent told and is very oldfashioned

235,6,5-Apr,Pete, Douche
236,6,5-Apr,Jim, Aw thanks Pete That was really nice I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight especially the Flordia cousins who obviously cant take a hint  Four years ago I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend And I had to do the hardest thing that Ive ever had to do which was just to wait Uh dont get me wrong I flirted with her Pam I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy Didnt need your help that many times And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick
237,6,5-Apr,Pam, Like a year
238,6,5-Apr,Jim, Ive been driving stick since high school So yes For a really long time thats all I had I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with but I think even then I knew that I was waiting for my wife So I would like to propose a toast So if youd all raise your glasses Not Pam for obvious reasons but everyone else If you would raise your glasses
239,6,5-Apr,Mema, Whats obvious Why cant Pam drink
240,6,5-Apr,Jim, Pam cant drink I didnt I shouldnt have said that I dont know why I did She can do whatever she wants though she shouldnt She shouldnt because shes an alcoholic Pam is an alcoholic Thats not true I no What we want the real reason is that that Pams pregnant
241,6,5-Apr,Michael,  Ok Ok Hey What I think Jim is trying to say is that they had an accident and you know what These two people theyre living together theyre having lots of consentual sex
242,6,5-Apr,Mema, They were living together
243,6,5-Apr,Michael, Yes Yes they were living together Yes and you know what You cant expect them to be careful every time Because frankly its just a different sensation
244,6,5-Apr,Jim, Michael
245,6,5-Apr,Michael, When you c well Am I wrong They say its not different but its a different sensation
246,6,5-Apr,Jim, Oh my God Please
247,6,5-Apr,Michael, When you use something to block I think everybody knows what I am talking about Its not necessarily different for the woman
248,6,5-Apr,Pam, Michael
249,6,5-Apr,Michael, but its different for the ok Ok
250,6,5-Apr,Pam, Michael Stop
251,6,5-Apr,Michael, Alright My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema I hope you heard every word
252,6,5-Apr,Jim, Alright

256,6,5-Apr,Mema, I should have known The hotels television set had a movie on called Bruno last night The remote control had so darn many buttons on it I couldnt turn it off So I had to just sit there while it happened to me I wondered How could they pick such a hotel Hmmm Now I know
257,6,5-Apr,Pam, Mema
258,6,5-Apr,Michael, That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it
259,6,5-Apr,Jim, I cant believe it was me
260,6,5-Apr,Michael, I know I cant believe it was you either I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me
261,6,5-Apr,Jim, Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things
262,6,5-Apr,Michael, I have not found that to be the case
263,6,5-Apr,Pam, Hey smooth guys
264,6,5-Apr,Jim, Im so sorry

31,6,6,Grotti, As a manager of business you have a lot of pride
32,6,6,Michael, Mmhm
33,6,6,Grotti, But you also got a lot of responsibility
34,6,6,Michael, Yep
35,6,6,Grotti, None greater perhaps than your need to be sure that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss
36,6,6,Michael, Okay
37,6,6,Michael, There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman than having to listen to a bad salesman Its like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player
38,6,6,Kevin, Jims gone on his honeymoon So I started borrowing his office to fart in Then one day I came in and I just stayed Cause this place is awesome It feels like home now Even better than my home My home sucks
39,6,6,Andy, What do you think
40,6,6,Dwight, I think youre right It definitely looks suspicious And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags
41,6,6,Grotti, God forbid you should have a fire in the warehouse
42,6,6,Michael, Oh yup Yeah definitely All that paper burning up
43,6,6,Grotti, Yeah and a truck goes off the side of the road theres injury

54,6,6,Dwight, Did he threaten you
55,6,6,Michael, No Dwight not everything is a threat
56,6,6,Andy, Mobsters are
57,6,6,Michael, There is no such things as monsters
58,6,6,Andy, He drives an SUV
59,6,6,Dwight, I knew it More trunk space Or should I say corpse space
60,6,6,Oscar, Hey guys I drive a SUV does that mean Im in the mob
61,6,6,Dwight, No not that by itself But look at all the facts He seems like a mobster
62,6,6,Michael, Wait when did we start talking about the mob The guy was trying to sell me insurance
63,6,6,Andy, All mobsters have a front sometimes its selling insurance sometimes its waste management or sanitation
64,6,6,Oscar, For the record not all ItalianAmericans are in the Mafia
65,6,6,Michael, I think he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance
66,6,6,Andy, Yeah buy my insurance or Ill burn your warehouse down
67,6,6,Dwight, Exactly
68,6,6,Michael, He did talk about a fire in the warehouse and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer
69,6,6,Oscar, Uhh All right who else is here 
70,6,6,Oscar, Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon So theres not the usual balance between sane and others Toby has mentally checked out since June Its a very dangerous time The coalition for reason is extremely weak
71,6,6,Toby, Oscar says I checked out huh Huh 
72,6,6,Michael,  Hey hey hey calm down Calm down Calm down Ryan you lived in New York what do you think
73,6,6,Ryan, Well first of all there is no such thing as The Mafia

80,6,6,Oscar, Its its a completely different name
81,6,6,Phyllis, So he wont get caught
82,6,6,Andy, Yeah Its pretty close
83,6,6,Oscar, No what are you talking about what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti It weakens it
84,6,6,Dwight, No I disagree R is among the most menacing of sounds Thats why they call it mrder And not muckduck
85,6,6,Michael, Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences
86,6,6,Dwight, Lock your door
87,6,6,Michael, Im not gonna lock my door

97,6,6,Michael, Its Grotti Hes following up
98,6,6,Andy, Already This this guy is persistent
99,6,6,Michael,  I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business
100,6,6,Dwight, Thats bad
101,6,6,Michael, Yeah
102,6,6,Dwight, Thats bad
103,6,6,Michael, Yeah What are my options here Do I just ignore it or

105,6,6,Michael, Okay Im calling the police
106,6,6,Andy,  That is the stupidest thing you could do right now
107,6,6,Dwight, Hes right Cops cant do anything until a crime has been reported
108,6,6,Michael, All right
109,6,6,Andy, Not only that but if they find out you snitched you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed

112,6,6,Michael, Thats not gonna happen
113,6,6,Dwight, Thats an exaggeration
114,6,6,Andy, Thats how it works
115,6,6,Michael, What am I supposed to do here
116,6,6,Andy, When somebody threatens you you give in right away Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
117,6,6,Michael, I was thinking exactly the same thing
118,6,6,Dwight, No criminals are like raccoons Okay you give em a taste of cat food pretty soon theyll be back for the whole cat
119,6,6,Andy, Dwight
120,6,6,Dwight, The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him Trust me I have bullied a lot of people

122,6,6,Andy, Wait lets hear him out this is interesting
123,6,6,Dwight, Heres what we do We meet him in a public place Ask him to lunch or something like that some place he cant be openly violent
124,6,6,Andy, Okay
125,6,6,Dwight, Let him know youre not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down That youre stubborn That you might even be a little bit dangerous
126,6,6,Andy,  I like this plan Id like to officially withdraw my plan
127,6,6,Michael, Hold on hold on Just
128,6,6,Andy, No no no My plan is out We do this the hard way

251,6,6,Dwight, Do you know what snap decision means
252,6,6,Michael, Yes
253,6,6,Dwight, It means like this

260,6,6,Michael, It wasnt easy I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency I chose massive coronary cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart Listen man I I got a problem I think Im in trouble with the mob Or a major insurance carrier
261,6,6,Jim, That sounds bad

268,6,6,Michael, What Wait I didnt hear a thing you just said
269,6,6,Jim, Just  and then youll be saved
270,6,6,Michael, No God I missed I missed the important part again
271,6,6,Jim, A ah
272,6,6,Michael, No Oh my God
273,6,6,Jim, And youll be saved
274,6,6,Michael, No Jim please repeat what youre saying I cant understand you
275,6,6,Jim, I  at the Bermuda Triangle An M please dont call again
276,6,6,Michael, Jim  Oh my God
277,6,6,Michael, Hey uh question for you I recently purchased some insurance that I cant afford given my present salary Is there anything accountingwise I can do to sort of make it all go away
278,6,6,Oscar, Accountingwise no But phonewise just call up and cancel it
279,6,6,Michael, Oh no Um What about this Cash For Clunkers thing
280,6,6,Oscar, Just no No
281,6,6,Michael, All right Well it was a thought Thanks
282,6,6,Dwight, We have let Michael down and its 85 percent your fault
283,6,6,Andy, Hes alive So youre welcome
284,6,6,Dwight, Not on the inside hes not Look at his life Broke Living in fear No friends dead end job
285,6,6,Andy, Yeah some of that existed before
286,6,6,Dwight, Not the living in fear thats new
287,6,6,Andy, Youre right that is new
288,6,6,Dwight, Yes Hes got to stand up to this mafia guy
289,6,6,Andy, Well I dont see that happening
290,6,6,Dwight, Me neither Not the way things are now But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy
291,6,6,Andy, Are you saying
292,6,6,Dwight, Yeah
293,6,6,Andy, That we surgically remove the fear center from Michaels brain
294,6,6,Dwight, What is wrong with you I am talking about convincing Michael that the guys not mafia
295,6,6,Andy, That seems a little farfetched
296,6,6,Dwight, Well more farfetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a lowlevel shakedown And that happened
297,6,6,Dwight, Michael Incredible news Grotti is clean
298,6,6,Michael, No Hes not Hes just good Nothing sticks to him You still dont understand how this works
299,6,6,Andy, No Michael What were trying to say is we made a mistake assuming he was mafia I have a buddy whos a Fed and we did a background check on the guy His background is perfectly clean
300,6,6,Dwight, Its true hes clean I have a couple of friends still on the force Checked with them Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasnt on the take Turns out hes a totally lovely guy Sweetest guy on the force really
301,6,6,Andy, Class act Boy scout
302,6,6,Michael, But Grotti acts like hes mafia though
303,6,6,Andy, Hes trying to intimidate you to close sales Hes just a pushy salesman
304,6,6,Dwight, And he made us all look like chumps
305,6,6,Michael, 
306,6,6,Michael, If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar I wish the mafia would go out and kll all the liars Bury them in my yard And I wouldnt tell the cops a thing Not that I would be lying per se But I would just get really quiet all of a sudden
307,6,6,Grotti, This is Grotti
308,6,6,Michael, This is Scott
309,6,6,Grotti, Oh Great Michael Im finishing up your paperwork right now
310,6,6,Michael, Oh really Is that supposed to scare me
311,6,6,Grotti, I I thought youd be pleased
312,6,6,Michael, Well you thought wrong Because I am not pleased Im actually kind of POd
313,6,6,Grotti, What
314,6,6,Michael, I think you know exactly why because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance
315,6,6,Grotti, I dont get it How was I scaring you
316,6,6,Michael, I think you knew exactly what you were doing And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk
317,6,6,Andy, Whoa Okay
318,6,6,Michael, You suck
319,6,6,Dwight, Okay thats
320,6,6,Michael, And Im not gonna buy your stupid insurance
321,6,6,Dwight, Thats good lets wrap it up
322,6,6,Michael, How about that The only person that actually needs insurance is you if you show your face around here again got it
323,6,6,Grotti, Look Michael when we all calm down here maybe at some point in the future you change your mind why dont you give me a call
324,6,6,Michael, Doubt it 
325,6,6,Dwight and Andy,  Oh man
326,6,6,Michael, What a tool  What
327,6,6,Andy, Next time you look in the mirror youre gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia
328,6,6,Michael, No What do you mean
329,6,6,Dwight, We just told you he wasnt mafia so you wouldnt be scared
330,6,6,Michael, What
331,6,6,Dwight, You successfully backed down the mob
332,6,6,Andy, You made the mafia apologize to you You made the mafia be polite
333,6,6,Michael, Oh man I should be mad at you guys But Im not
334,6,6,Michael, So I looked him in the eye and I said Not today Grotti Not today And not tomorrow and not the next day Or the day after that And you can tell all your friends that if I see them then theyre already dead I said something like that
335,6,6,Dwight, Very close
336,6,6,Oscar, Just to be clear he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg

121,6,7,Michael, You want me to be happy
122,6,7,Pam, Of course
123,6,7,Michael, Part of the problem is she is the mother of a close friend of mine
124,6,7,Pam, Oh
125,6,7,Michael, More than a friend a coworker
126,6,7,Pam, Oh Gossip who is it Who is it Who is it Michael Who

138,6,7,Pam,  How could you do this to me Hes my boss How many times have I complained about him to you No I am not being dramatic you are being crazy
139,6,7,Jim,  Who wants a hot chocolate

155,6,7,Dwight, What were you talking about in there
156,6,7,Andy, Trust me it would only make you mad 
157,6,7,Michael,  Due to a certain recent incident corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities
158,6,7,Andy, Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill
159,6,7,Michael, That was a hit job If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster So if there is a lesson to be learned here and Im not sure that there is it is that in order to help our communities we need to put other peoples needs ahead of our own
160,6,7,Pam, Haha Ha ha ha
161,6,7,Jim, And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a 50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice

351,6,9,Michael, I dont know
352,6,9,Dwight, Lets get some raw meat on that face I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs
353,6,9,Michael, As I watched Pams big strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes And guess what I have four kids And I have a hovercar and a hoverhouse And my wife is a runner and it shows And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together And I am happy and I am rich and I never die It doesnt sound like much but its enough for me
354,6,9,Michael, Ahh 
355,6,9,Dwight, Good good Keep it on there for another five minutes Just let the swelling go down
356,6,9,Michael, Oh thank you Thanks I owe you one Dwight
357,6,9,Dwight, Fire Jim
358,6,9,Michael, No
359,6,9,Dwight, Im cashing in the favor Fire him
360,6,9,Michael, What are you talking about
361,6,9,Dwight, Do it Promote me Trimanagers
362,6,9,Michael, Forget that
363,6,9,Dwight, Can I have an office
364,6,9,Michael, No
365,6,9,Dwight, You know what you can keep your stupid favor Its worthless And this is my dinner on your face Im keeping it
366,6,9,Michael,  Oh that feels better
0,6,10,Dwight,  Got you Broken arm Boom Boom Boom Broken Nose Boom Boom Boom Boom Broken Nose Boom Ha gonna flip you
1,6,10,Jim, Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate because as we all know the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change
2,6,10,Dwight, How can I pose this to you in a relatable way You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum and you are attacked by triads how can you hold them off until your clan arrives You cannot go wrong with a throat punch 
3,6,10,Jim, OK so theres no defense for that good to know
4,6,10,Dwight, No there is a defense for that Let me demonstrate Someone attack me Kevin go
5,6,10,Kevin, No way Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace
6,6,10,Dwight, False I did choke you with your shoelace Now come at me
7,6,10,Jim, OK with all due respect to everyone here I think the most worthy opponent of you is you
8,6,10,Dwight, That is correct Unless there happened to be measles present
9,6,10,Jim, So lets just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch Now how would you Dwight defend against it
10,6,10,Dwight, Easy Allow me to demonstrate I am attacking myself with a throat punch Here it comes  Block Grasp wrist as such 
11,6,10,Jim, And what if he comes at you with the other hand because he does have two
12,6,10,Dwight, Good point Second throat punch absorb the blow  Groin punch hip block elbow to the gut Uh oh up to the nose No youre not Ow Oh
13,6,10,Jim, Oh my God hes making you look like such a fool
14,6,10,Dwight, He really is but not for long  Ow Instep oh not again  You let go you let go Oh youre right I cant hold on
15,6,10,Jim, You two are so evenly matched I dont know how one of you is going to get the upper hand
16,6,10,Dwight, The important thing to remember Jim we always have what is called the element of surprise 
17,6,10,Michael, But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy
18,6,10,Andy, I did stand up comedy once
19,6,10,Michael, You did
20,6,10,Andy, Yeah I klled
21,6,10,Michael, That sounds like it was hilarious
22,6,10,Andy, It was hilarious
23,6,10,Dwight, Michael
24,6,10,Michael, Yes
25,6,10,Dwight, What is the meaning of this email that everyone got
26,6,10,Michael, Youll have to be more specific Dwight I get like eight emails a day
27,6,10,Dwight, This one from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin
28,6,10,Michael, Woo hoo shout out
29,6,10,Dwight, Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal I just want to stress that its all conjecture If theres any concrete news you will know ASAP
30,6,10,Michael, Erin do we have the journal
31,6,10,Erin, Your feelings journal You told me to put it in the time capsule
32,6,10,Michael, Did you
33,6,10,Pam, Michael he means the Wall Street Journal online
34,6,10,Michael, Oh the Wall
35,6,10,Oscar, I found the article  On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflins It is rumored that they will recommend  and the article cuts off
36,6,10,Michael, Its 199 to finish the article I wonder what it was going to say 
37,6,10,Jim, Are you serious 
38,6,10,Andy, I got it I got it Oh Tuna beat me to it
39,6,10,Phyllis, It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy
40,6,10,Michael, No no that doesnt make any sense
41,6,10,Stanley, Oh lord were all gonna lose our jobs
42,6,10,Oscar, Not necessarily bankruptcy could mean a lot of things Maybe theyre just restructuring to get out of debt
43,6,10,Michael, Oh that sounds awful
44,6,10,Oscar, Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin
45,6,10,Michael, Oh God Well thats an interesting theory
46,6,10,Dwight, You know what You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows It doesnt pay much and you cant unionize
47,6,10,David Wallace's Secretary, Im sorry Michael Davids in a meeting
48,6,10,Michael, Ah well maybe you should spy on him  Oh my God wouldnt that be hilarious

55,6,10,Kelly,  Guys what if this is our last day at work What if we never see each other ever again 
56,6,10,Andy, I like Erin There I said it I was kinda hoping she would ask me out but things have not panned out on that front so it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws
57,6,10,Jim,  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering whats going to happen
58,6,10,Michael, OK we need some sort of distraction for everybody Anything new on YouTube Doesnt even need to be good Oh God I cant think need more Mullins
59,6,10,Jim, Listen Wallace said these were just rumors right So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine So if we just go on with our work you and me theyll follow along

66,6,10,Jim, Sure Im a little nervous but doing our work will make us feel better I only slack off when things are good
67,6,10,Jim, Customers have to use the coupon code from the website And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero but we are working on that Stay tuned for that
68,6,10,Dwight,  He needs me Seat saved infinity 
69,6,10,Jim, OK great
70,6,10,Michael,  What Oh my God  There has been a mrder Theres been a mrder in Savannah

72,6,10,Meredith,  Belles Bourbon and Bullets a mrder mystery dinner party game
73,6,10,Michael, It is so much fun Everybody plays a character we go around the room we try to figure out who did it

77,6,10,Michael, Tube City you owe me one

86,6,10,Michael, OK here are your character cards Take one pass it down Here is your prop box some of your characters will have props Now on your character card it tells you who you are and what your alibi is Everything else is up to your imagination So if you talk slowly in real life your character could say have been kicked in the head by a horse

88,6,10,Michael, OK use your imaginations
89,6,10,Andy, Whod you get

110,6,10,Meredith, Nice accent You sound like Forrest Gump
111,6,10,Pam, I do not
112,6,10,Andy, Well you do actually Youve got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent which is more like molasses just sorta spillin out of your mouth
113,6,10,Kevin, Oooo now do the Swedish chef
114,6,10,Andy, Uh not familiar what province is he from
115,6,10,Kevin, He lives on Sesame Street dumbass

128,6,10,Andy,  Hey there young lady
129,6,10,Erin, Hello
130,6,10,Andy, I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend
131,6,10,Erin, Sounds like a plan Sugar
132,6,10,Andy, Alright a plan it is
133,6,10,Dwight, Voodoo Mama Juju explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts
134,6,10,Angela, Its not my fault I was exposed to Harry Potter
135,6,10,Dwight, I know you did it
136,6,10,Dwight, I know she didnt do it Its never the person you most suspect Its also never the person you least suspect since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most Therefore I know the kller to be Phyllis AKA Beatrix Bourbon the person I most medium suspect
137,6,10,Kevin,  Do you want to go out on a date with me We can make out by the horses
138,6,10,Erin, Well you know ol Nellies always up for a romp in the hay
139,6,10,Meredith, How about a threesome
140,6,10,Erin, Yeah my boudoirs always open
141,6,10,Kevin, Nice
142,6,10,Andy, Im a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin Which would be a whole lot less appealing because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone And she might be a mrderr
143,6,10,Oscar, I just got an email from corporate specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors
144,6,10,Phyllis, What does that mean
145,6,10,Oscar, Well maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity
146,6,10,Michael,  Whoa Whats this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth son This heres Savannah
147,6,10,Oscar,  This plantation were running low on greenbacks Were having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt We cant pay   Michael I cant  Basically it could mean a lot of things but it is unprecedented so its cause for concern
148,6,10,Jim, OK Im going back to work
149,6,10,Michael, No no no no no no no  Im going to skip forward to a relevant clue Here we go
150,6,10,Voice on CD player, Well by now youve figured out that ol Beatrix Bourbon was the kller
151,6,10,Phyllis, Michael I was doing so well
152,6,10,Michael,  Are you going to believe that That is a mis thats a misdirection We still dont know who the mrderr is  Nellie Nutmeg come back in here I cant do this myself Voodoo Mama Juju what am I gonna do
153,6,10,Jim, OK so Corporate is still in their meeting
154,6,10,Kevin, That could be a good sign
155,6,10,Angela, Hey everyone Kevins going to give us his take on the situation Lets listen up
156,6,10,Jim, Alright guys its a work day and you guys work here so lets go do some work
157,6,10,Kevin, Now Jim telling us all to work I think that is a very good sign
158,6,10,Angela, Dont just say things
159,6,10,Jim,  Oh hey Michael Listen I brought up those sales targets Do you want to
160,6,10,Michael,  I do believe you have me mistaken my name is Caleb Crawdad Yall skedaddled way too soon We need to reopen this case
161,6,10,Jim, No youre not reopening the case The case is closed
162,6,10,Michael, No it aint
163,6,10,Dwight, Frankly Im not surprised A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns
164,6,10,Andy, Just thinking about Weekend at Bernies Its funny the guys dead the whole time
165,6,10,Erin, I havent seen it
166,6,10,Andy, Speaking of weekends you excited about our date this weekend

172,6,10,Andy, Did you mean a real date
173,6,10,Erin, No  Did you
174,6,10,Andy, Totally not 
175,6,10,Erin, I thought it was for real So I was excited but it was just it was part of the game
176,6,10,Dwight, Youre sure it was water it couldnt have been acid
177,6,10,Michael, I already declared you it was too dark to tell
178,6,10,Dwight, Stop playing games with me Crawdad
179,6,10,Michael, This is not a game this is my life You are out of order sir
180,6,10,Dwight, Answer me
181,6,10,Michael, You are out of order
182,6,10,Dwight, You are out of order
183,6,10,Michael, You are
184,6,10,Pam, I think Michael may have snapped
185,6,10,Jim, Or maybe hes just stuck in character
186,6,10,Pam, Well which is worse Snapped or stuck
187,6,10,Jim, Both Theyre both worse
188,6,10,Jim, Its going to be alright Were a good company well figure this out Were not going under
189,6,10,Pam, Jim what if we both lose our jobs Im trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine and I cant think of one
190,6,10,Michael,  Deb what in the world  do you have the vapors
191,6,10,Jim, Michael not now
192,6,10,Michael, Cant wait we have to get you to our witch doctor right now Come on Come on
193,6,10,Pam, I should just go  Where to now Caleb
194,6,10,Michael, To Mama Juju Boo Boo
195,6,10,Jim, Michael can I OK Im just going to skip right past the what and go with why
196,6,10,Michael, Because this is the recreation of a crime scene
197,6,10,Meredith,  Im the dead body and these are my brain chunks
198,6,10,Dwight, Hey shut up Youre dead
199,6,10,Jim, Michael can I talk to you in your office
200,6,10,Michael, No Michael here my name is

205,6,10,Erin, Wallace is on the phone Hes returning your call
206,6,10,Michael, Detective Wallace
207,6,10,Erin, I dont think so I think its David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin
208,6,10,Michael, Aw shucks tell him Im not here
209,6,10,Oscar, Youre not gonna answer the phone
210,6,10,Michael, No I only answer to Detective Wallace cause I got a warm body in the other room
211,6,10,Jim, Ill take it
212,6,10,Jim, Hey David
213,6,10,David, Hey sorry to be getting back to you guys so late Things are still a bit unclear we didnt officially decide anything yet
214,6,10,Jim, Oh OK
215,6,10,David, But if I can be candid with you here Jim its not good We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year Insolvent So well You know what Im sorry I have to run But we will talk soon OK
216,6,10,Jim, Sure Oh you know while I have you today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to
217,6,10,David, You know what I cant really get my head around anything like that right now but thats great Keep after it but I gotta run
218,6,10,Jim, OK
219,6,10,David, Thanks Jim
220,6,10,Jim, See ya
221,6,10,Pam,  Whats the news
222,6,10,Jim, Nothing yet
223,6,10,Phyllis, Well I guess thats not
224,6,10,Jim, Well there is some bad news  There has been another mrder
225,6,10,Michael, A mrder you say I do declare
226,6,10,Jim, Conference room everyone
227,6,10,Stanley, Do we have to play
228,6,10,Jim, No
229,6,10,Stanley, Super
230,6,10,Dwight, Oh this could be a juicy one
231,6,10,Michael, Get in there
232,6,10,Jim, I think today was a good day to have two managers Cause if youre a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean one parent might want to just keep rowing But if the other parent wants to play a game its not because theyre crazy Its because theyre doing it for the kids And I get that now
233,6,10,Michael, There has been a lot of mrder and a lot of intrigue My little heart can barely take it no more  Today is the hardest I have worked in a long long time

1,6,11,Dwight, Bow down before Recyclops
2,6,11,Jim, Five years ago corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops
3,6,11,Dwight, Happy Earth Day everyone Im Recyclops Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter
4,6,11,Jim, The next year he really stepped things up
5,6,11,Dwight, Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin
6,6,11,Jim, A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape
7,6,11,Dwight, Recylops will drown you in your overwatered lawns
8,6,11,Jim, Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing I cant remember
9,6,11,Dwight, Recyclops will have his revenge
10,6,11,Jim, I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved
11,6,11,Pam, Oh my God you guys look Its Recyclops
12,6,11,Dwight, Recyclops destroys 
13,6,11,Stanley, Oh is today Recyclops Day

16,6,11,Dwight, Polluticorn wishes 
17,6,11,Andy, Thats aerosol spray Its terrible for the environment
18,6,11,Dwight, Humans are terrible for the environment
19,6,11,Pam, The thing I like most about Recyclops is that hes creating a different world for our child
20,6,11,Jim, Mmm
21,6,11,Pam, A world where you truly can be anything you want
22,6,11,Jim, God bless you Recyclops And your cold robot heart

148,6,12,Kevin, I I I did not That was not How come not
149,6,12,Jim, Guys listen This was anonymous all right There is no way I couldve given it to myself because I didnt even know who was on here I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score
150,6,12,Angela, To my tally you just won back your own parking spot a vacation day and a nice tidy quarter of 1000 from all of us
151,6,12,Jim, Will everybody stop for a second because obviously Im not taking any of it A mistake has been made and well figure it out Second of all there was no cash prize
152,6,12,Angela, Yes
153,6,12,Jim, Dwight
154,6,12,Dwight, Yeah you said In an ideal world there would be a cash prize Isnt that what you said
155,6,12,Jim, No Dwight I meant Yes in a perfect world someone would get money But
156,6,12,Phyllis, Yeah but in your perfect world only you get money

158,6,12,Michael, All right Wow Um I am never going to forget today Not a chance I dont think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today Who here has done something stupid in their lives Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between A gym and B gym that sort of thing Show of hands anybody yes a bunch of you okay Well me too Ive done something stupid which I would like to share Ummm  Should we go
159,6,12,Teacher, Oh no Were okay Its a double period
160,6,12,Michael, Ah All right I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable But you know whats invaluable is intuition You know what that is That is the ability to know when something is about to happen Does anybody out there have intuition Know whats gonna happen next Nobody Okay youre going to make me say it All right I am so proud of all of you Derrick and Lefevre and Ben and Ayana and Mikela and Nikki and Jason and Im sorry okay sorry spacing your name
161,6,12,Zion, Im Zion Im Mikelas younger brother
162,6,12,Michael, Well Zion I am not going to be paying for your college tuition Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybodys tuition Im so so sorry
163,6,12,Michael, Im sorry Im sorry Im so sorry
164,6,12,Mikela, You lied to us
165,6,12,Michael, I lied to myself too Im not a millionaire I thought I would be by the time I was 30 but I wasnt even close And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40 but by 40 I had less money than when I was 30 Maybe by my 50s I dont know I wanted to pay for your education I really did It was my dream Some people have evil drems some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams My dream was in the right place
166,6,12,Lefevre, You owe this to us
167,6,12,Michael, Okay hold on Hold on Now I cant pay for your college But you dont have to go to class to be in class Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop  Which is rendered useless without batteries and I have one for each of you
168,6,12,Students, 
169,6,12,Michael, Hey holdhold on hold on hold on hold on Theyre lithium
170,6,12,Jim, Look there was a big mistake obviously so I will fix it Okay This was your idea anyway

174,6,12,Creed, Guys Im starting to think Pams not really even pregnant
175,6,12,Pam, Ok for the record I am pregnant and obviously there has been some kind of a mistake so why doesnt Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and well move on
176,6,12,Phyllis, Thats fair
177,6,12,Dwight, Excellent idea Pam
178,6,12,Pam, Thank you
179,6,12,Andy, That would be employee number three which would be son of a bitch Pam Halpert
180,6,12,Phyllis, How is that possible No offense Pam but how the hell is that possible
181,6,12,Dwight, There must be some reasonable explanation for this
182,6,12,Pam, No wait come on I didnt miss a day I came in early I stayed late and I doubled my sales last month
183,6,12,Andy, Oh really From what two to four

61,6,15,Pam, We found a great local daycare Its rated really high by all the local parenting websites But that means its also really hard to get into
62,6,15,Jim, Turns out a lot of parents want the very best for their children Thats weird
63,6,15,Pam, Were hoping our interview seals the deal
64,6,15,Jim, But if not theres always the army The infantry
65,6,15,Pam, Okay Okay Yeah
66,6,15,Christian Slater, So youve just been bought by Sabre Youve probably got a lot of questions Hi Im Christian Slater Whats it like to work for Sabre Lets find out together Working at Sabre means taking on the challenge of the road that rises to meet you Sabre is respecting the past but opening a window to the future Have you ever tasted a rainbow At Sabre you will
67,6,15,Jo Bennett, Youll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit Welcome Were very excited to go on this journey with you
68,6,15,Jim,  So youve been shown a nonsensical video Youre probably wondering Whats going on Well youre not alone
69,6,15,Michael, Wow Really terrific
70,6,15,Gabe, Most of our business comes from selling printers So dont think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore but as printer salesmen who also sell paper
71,6,15,Michael, Perfect
72,6,15,Michael, No Dont like that
73,6,15,Gabe, At Sabre we really encourage honest communication You should always feel free to express your thoughts your 
74,6,15,Meredith, Talk about vacation days
75,6,15,Gabe, We have a policy here at Sabre where we are uh allowed to take two weeks
76,6,15,Oscar, But I banked six weeks
77,6,15,Angela, I already booked a Great Lakes cruise
78,6,15,Meredith, Hey who the hells going through our stuff
79,6,15,Gabe, Actually thats Nick Hes your new IT guy Uh hes setting up a site blocker Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites And then there are the timewasting sites like Twitter YouTube We are blocking those as well
80,6,15,Michael, Mm nope Dont like that
81,6,15,Gabe, Ok did everyone get one With these bottles we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles which are the scourge of the environment
82,6,15,Michael, Well still get to use the little cups though right
83,6,15,Gabe, Little cups Like paper or plastic or 
84,6,15,Michael, I dont know what theyre made of
85,6,15,Dwight, Theyre 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic He goes through 20 a day
86,6,15,Gabe, Ok well I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle
87,6,15,Michael, You know what cant fit in a bottle are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everythings running smoothly And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley
88,6,15,Stanley, Thats ok
89,6,15,Michael, There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company But 70 percent of me is water and the other part the real part the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and if I can be crass makes babies that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba 
90,6,15,Michael,  Really You dont have enough water in there Your stomach
91,6,15,Toby, Oop
92,6,15,Michael, What
93,6,15,Toby, Looks like we kicked it 
94,6,15,Michael, I miss the old Dunder Mifflin Too much change is not a good thing Ask the climate
95,6,15,Michael, I dont want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabres doing for us
96,6,15,Gabe, Oh I dont get that sense at all from you so
97,6,15,Michael, Well you should have a little But its great that you dont because I am trying to embrace all of these changes but Im  Ill be honest Im having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of em
98,6,15,Gabe, Which ones
99,6,15,Michael, All of them
100,6,15,Gabe, Well I wish that I could do something but its kind of policy you know Above my pay grade You know
101,6,15,Michael, So maybe we should call We should call someone I could help Im good with bosses Call one of the higherups
102,6,15,Gabe, You know what Let me see what I can do
103,6,15,Jim,  Ok this is officially the cutest thing Ive ever seen Cubbies I totally forgot about cubbies
104,6,15,Pam, Theres a fingerpainting station and a curly slide Am I too old to go here
105,6,15,Jim, Oh Adorable right  I walked in on someone in the bathroom

113,6,15,Erin, Well I saw them in there
114,6,15,Andy, Well maybe they ran away because the pizza was like  Hey get out of here you stupid strawberries
115,6,15,Erin, I think when Andy finally asks me out hes going to try to top what he did with the drum line I cant wait to see what he comes up with
116,6,15,Andy, The balls totally in Erins court After the whole drum line thing
117,6,15,Gabe,  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say in just the way you wanted me to say it so
118,6,15,Jo, Gabe honey I love this I love the sound of your voice But I really need some new information now
119,6,15,Gabe, Ok um I told the story of your uncle and I have a feeling that you would have  really been proud of the way Okay um

127,6,15,Michael, Well I am little concerned with all of these changes to be quite frank I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time and 
128,6,15,Jo, Pardon Pardon me Mr Scott but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin it was my grandsons snowball company so youll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things
129,6,15,Michael, Ok I feel very strongly that you cant just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever Is Christian Slater back there Because he knows Hed know what to do
130,6,15,Jo, So listen why dont you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you cant handle the changes
131,6,15,Michael, I have already told him but I will tell him again if you think that will help

188,6,15,Jerry, And you  you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going
189,6,15,Jim, No
190,6,15,Pam, Maybe because it doesnt seem to be going super well
191,6,15,Jerry, Well you didnt consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well
192,6,15,Pam, Nope Cause were really nice people but you dont seem to like us

105,6,16,Michael, I will try to manage my excitement
106,6,16,Michael, I have been saying the word manager a lot so whenever Jo thinks manager she thinks of me Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a pen1s I cant even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a pen1s And viseversa
107,6,16,Jo, I think thats it So were all good  Thanks yall
108,6,16,Dwight,  I uh
109,6,16,Kelly,  Oh my God
110,6,16,Kelly, I guess Andy likes me I never thought of him in that way But I guess in most romantic comedies the guy youre supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual
111,6,16,Pam, So check this out According to the handbook you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager They have all these incentive programs I ran your numbers from last year
112,6,16,Jim, This is way more than I make now
113,6,16,Jim, I dont think Im gonna miss being manager You know how some people say theyre not in it for the money Well with all due respect to this job I think Im definitely in it for the money And quite honestly the women
114,6,16,Jim, Hey you got a second
115,6,16,Michael, Sure You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk
116,6,16,Jim, Actually yeah
117,6,16,Michael, What
118,6,16,Jim, Exactly that I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do
119,6,16,Michael, What Really
120,6,16,Jim, Yeah
121,6,16,Michael, Wow
122,6,16,Michael, La la la hello Oscar
123,6,16,Oscar, Michael Reading
124,6,16,Michael, What are you reading
125,6,16,Oscar, The Atlantic
126,6,16,Michael, Oh that is my favorite ocean I love it I am so happy right now No I cant keep it a secret any longer Jim is stepping down to salesman I am going to be the sole manager once again
127,6,16,Oscar, I should step into sales myself
128,6,16,Michael, Why is there an untapped gay market
129,6,16,Oscar, Sabre has no caps on commissions He can make a lot more money in sales
130,6,16,Michael, Where did you get that information
131,6,16,Oscar, Manual
132,6,16,Michael, Manuel who
133,6,16,Michael, Well according to the manual there is no cap on commissions I have been hustled
134,6,16,Michael, Son of a bitch  Pardon me
135,6,16,Jo, Oh speak of the devil We were just talking about you Have a seat
136,6,16,Michael, Okay
137,6,16,Jo, Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager
138,6,16,Michael, Really Aw that is so sweet of you But I cannot accept because I have been thinking about it and I think I wanna go back to sales
139,6,16,Jo, Really
140,6,16,Jim, Really
141,6,16,Michael, Yeah You can take the man out of the salesman but you cant take the sales out of salesman
142,6,16,Jo, Well I think youre both being a little too modest
143,6,16,Jim, No I really really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons
144,6,16,Michael, No I think I would be bad I would sleep in my office and I would sexually harass people
145,6,16,Jim, Why would you do that
146,6,16,Michael, Im turning myself in right now
147,6,16,Jo, You know Michael you have more experience in sales and management so Im gonna defer to your judgment
148,6,16,Michael, Thank you
149,6,16,Jo, I think you  will become the salesman and congratulations  Youre gonna be the new manager of this branch
150,6,16,Michael, Great Thats great Congratulations Have fun signing my commission checks boss
151,6,16,Pam,  Oh Michael marked his heights Hes grown
152,6,16,Jim, Mm
153,6,16,Dwight,  Bobcat this is Dragon Listen Hes been promoted to sole manager Weve got to step this up Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds  89 88
154,6,16,Dwight, Youre twenty minutes late
155,6,16,Ryan,  Um I was at another dumpster
156,6,16,Dwight, Just admit you lost track of time
157,6,16,Dwight, Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim Ryan is always late for our meetings I wish I had a lair
158,6,16,Ryan, Did you see Saw
159,6,16,Dwight, Of course I seesaw Mose and I seesaw all the time
160,6,16,Ryan, No uh the movie Did you see the movie Saw
161,6,16,Dwight, Oh yeah Great film Almost as fun as going on a seesaw
162,6,16,Ryan, Okay the reason these movies are so popular is the element of psychological torment
163,6,16,Dwight, I like where youre going with this Continue
164,6,16,Ryan, Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something
165,6,16,Dwight, I have an old barn
166,6,16,Ryan, Yes
167,6,16,Dwight, Its kinda smelly but that might be a plus And then what
168,6,16,Ryan, We do what they did in Saw  I mean we dont kll him obviously I have a mask
169,6,16,Dwight, Okay thats your idea Exactly like in the movie That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life
170,6,16,Ryan, Well suggest something else then Dont just
171,6,16,Dwight, Hes supposed to cut his leg off Think
172,6,16,Ryan, Dont just criticize my idea
173,6,16,Dwight, Think
174,6,16,Ryan, You think of something then
175,6,16,Erin, Michael Im worried that uh not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk
176,6,16,Michael, How is that possible
177,6,16,Erin, Well in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space
178,6,16,Michael, No excuses Erin come on Make it happen
179,6,16,Erin, You know I actually think I should get back to work Jim asked me to do some stuff and hes manager
180,6,16,Michael, Oh yeah Fine fine Leave it here I have to make some sales anyway Who should I call with my magic sales fingers  Michael Scott head of sales
181,6,16,Jim,  You gotta do something man You cant just sit there
182,6,16,Dwight, The new IT guy Nick
183,6,16,Ryan, Nick
184,6,16,Dwight, I think he is the key Hes very trusting hes looking for friends he has been given an awesome amount of power and does not know how to wield it
185,6,16,Ryan, Like Frodo
186,6,16,Dwight, Why dont you just let me handle the Tolkien references okay dumb jock
187,6,16,Ryan, Well I think he can be corrupted Like Gollum
188,6,16,Dwight, Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum
189,6,16,Dwight, I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one
190,6,16,Erin, Whos hungry
191,6,16,Jim, What is that
192,6,16,Erin,30 and say Whos hungry
193,6,16,Jim, Oh Im fine Thank you though
194,6,16,Erin, Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy
195,6,16,Jim, Why would I wanna do that
196,6,16,Erin, Its a thinking technique All the top executives do it It keeps the brain moving and a spinning brain is a working brain
197,6,16,Jim, For now Im just gonna go back to work here
198,6,16,Erin, Oh sure
199,6,16,Jim, Yeah Thank you
200,6,16,Erin, Well

213,6,16,Erin, Its no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card I cant compete with her That girl can sing and dance and gets all of her clothes at the mall And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl cause Andy Bernard is a playboy And why shouldnt he be Hes got it all
214,6,16,Dwight, Hoho There he is the IT guy So you discovered the break room
215,6,16,Nick, Uh yep
216,6,16,Dwight, I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is you get to know everyones computer passwords
217,6,16,Nick, No I actually dont
218,6,16,Dwight, Listen I know you have to say that but we got a little problem here There is an employee named Jim Halpert and he is doing some terrible things okay He is molesting people via the internet And we need to stop him
219,6,16,Nick, I think that you should call the cops
220,6,16,Dwight, No the cops called us So Im gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halperts computer
221,6,16,Nick, I dont know what to tell you man Im sorry I just cant give out his password like that
222,6,16,Ryan, Nick We could make things very very difficult for you

8,6,17/18,Kevin, I cooked my way through Julia Childs cookbook and now Im halfway through the Twilight cookbook Last night I had Edwards corn flake chicken
9,6,17/18,Pam, Hmm
10,6,17/18,Kevin, Pregnant Pam and I we get hungry at the same times so weve been eating together a lot Not all meals Just second breakfast lunch second lunch and first dinner
11,6,17/18,Kevin, I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner One last ultra feast
12,6,17/18,Pam, Mmmm that sounds great What are you thinking
13,6,17/18,Kevin, I think it should be a surprise
14,6,17/18,Meredith,  Oh getting there huh
15,6,17/18,Pam, No no I still have time
16,6,17/18,Pam, Im having contractions but theyre irregular and far apart So Im not really in labor Im near labor
17,6,17/18,Jim, Yeah were slowplaying it because of our stupid HMO
18,6,17/18,Pam, If we check in after midnight I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors
19,6,17/18,Jim, Not to mention the extra nights sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home if its crying all night one of us is going to have to take care of it And I do not plan on helping unless its a boy
20,6,17/18,Pam, I cannot wait for that joke to be over
21,6,17/18,Pam, Ooh
22,6,17/18,Michael, Oh oh oh Contraption Shes contrapting Okay you know what I think I should drive you guys to the hospital and here is why I am a licensed classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania I gassed up the car
23,6,17/18,Jim, Michael
24,6,17/18,Michael, Actually I put diesel in this time trying to save some money
25,6,17/18,Jim, Michael you shouldnt have done that
26,6,17/18,Michael, Happy to do it Also I did a heck of a job babyproofing this office
27,6,17/18,Pam, You know the babys not going to live here right
28,6,17/18,Michael, Well the baby was conceived here so might as well live here a little bit too
29,6,17/18,Jim, Hmm that logics airtight but unfortunately it wasnt conceived here Burning man portopotty
30,6,17/18,Michael, Oh yuck TMI How was it I dont want to know Tell me later Lets go Lets go Hospital
31,6,17/18,Pam, Okay okay were not going to the hospital We are waiting until midnight
32,6,17/18,Erin, Ooh spooky But why
33,6,17/18,Jim, Because the insurance company only covers two nights
34,6,17/18,Pam, Everythings fine We have plenty of time
35,6,17/18,Nick, Well you dont want to wait too long Pam Otherwise the babys going to become a teenager in there and youll be up all night from the rock music
36,6,17/18,Michael, Shut up Nick What a weird thing to say Weird IT nerd Dont get revenge on me nerd
37,6,17/18,Angela,  What are you looking at
38,6,17/18,Dwight, Ha nerd
39,6,17/18,Kelly, Did you know that labor can last weeks Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table and sometimes epidurals dont work and you can poop yourself
40,6,17/18,Dwight,  Bare my child
41,6,17/18,Angela, Excuse me
42,6,17/18,Dwight,00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out

47,6,17/18,Jim, I Pam please
48,6,17/18,Pam, Im going to be okay we should really try to make it until midnight
49,6,17/18,Andy, Yeah no you really should Because if your babys born tomorrow hes going to have the same birthday as Buttmud Brooks My old roommate
50,6,17/18,Pam, Did you hear that Buttmud Brooks
51,6,17/18,Jim, Okay but we are leaving at five minutes apart
52,6,17/18,Pam, Five minutes apart
53,6,17/18,Jim, So the plan was seven minutes But were calling an audible because thats her call Because shes the quarterback Im just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant
54,6,17/18,Pam, Okay stop watching me
55,6,17/18,Jim, Okay crazy I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you like sell printers
56,6,17/18,Pam, Mmhmm
57,6,17/18,Jim, Well not until Friday 20 off toner cartridges thats a big deal While were on the subject why dont I just run you down to the hospital and well just do a quick check
58,6,17/18,Pam, Not until midnight
59,6,17/18,Andy, Guys Word of advice Speaking as a former baby Dont get too hung up on baby names I was named Walter Jr after my father until I was about six or so when my parents changed their minds
60,6,17/18,Erin, I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr
61,6,17/18,Andy, My brother was born and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr name so they gave it to him I was given Andrew which they got out of a baby name book
62,6,17/18,Jim, You know its getting real crowded in here Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the days not out yet
63,6,17/18,Michael, No no no no no You know what You cant tell us what to do because you are not comanager anymore
64,6,17/18,Jim,  Okay I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her bodys signals
65,6,17/18,Pam, Actually the distractions are good I mean I dont think Im going to make it until midnight if Im just sitting here thinking about it
66,6,17/18,Michael, Distractions are good That means conference room five minutes No no five seconds Right now right now Conference room Topic potpourri Lets go
67,6,17/18,Michael, Um I am sort of a master of distraction When I was a kid my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class Try to think what were the first thirteen colonies Mmhmm mmhmm 
68,6,17/18,Michael, The purpose for this meeting is to take Pams mind off of whats going on inside of her body

62,6,19,Dwight, I mean youre here at work and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father
63,6,19,Jim, Is that what happened to you
64,6,19,Dwight, Ill tell you what happened to me I didnt see my father for the first two years of my life I thought my mother was my father and my wetnurse was my mother

74,6,19,Jo, Thank you You know I get way too many ideas from the top Now I want to hear your ideas I mean did you guys know that Liquid Paper That wasnt invented by some fancy engineer No that was created by a lowly typist

81,6,19,Michael, Daryl Mellow soulful smart for warehouse
82,6,19,Jo, Okay hush now
83,6,19,Michael, Okay
84,6,19,Daryl, The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper but printers and paper ship differently Itll be faster to deliver them separately instead of waiting on everything to come in
85,6,19,Jo, But you wouldnt need more trucks
86,6,19,Daryl, Not at all Theres a way that it can be scheduled I sketched this out downstairs
87,6,19,Jo, Oh look at you

49,6,22,Michael, Ugh
50,6,22,Erin, Just the two of us
51,6,22,Michael, Well Hayworths is more business casual and they always screw up your order So Im
52,6,22,Erin, Yeah okay Yeah that was a stupid suggestion I was thinking someplace special so I though Hayworths but
53,6,22,Michael, Okay well well figure something

71,6,22,Kevin,  Do my hands feel sweaty to you 
72,6,22,Gabe, The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco Either they dont respect me or they respect me too much And some of them still think that Im the IT guy This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that Im an authority figure
73,6,22,Gabe, Hello everyone If I might have a moment of your time Its come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video It is now forbidden to talk joke about or email this around

76,6,22,Michael,  Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape Im kind of a bookworm This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire
77,6,22,Erin, I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager
78,6,22,Michael,  I dont know
79,6,22,Erin, I would have chosen the 1490s

155,6,22,Jim, Sorry Gabe but that show hasnt been on in many cookies
156,6,22,Gabe, Ok
157,6,22,Andy, Hey Can I have your attention please First of all thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together And a very special shoutout to the chair of the Party Planning Committee miss Angela Martin You have outdone yourself
158,6,22,Michael, You know what I think we can all agree that Angelas not so great so
159,6,22,Andy, I am saying the exact opposite Angela is fantastic
160,6,22,Michael, No No No
161,6,22,Andy, Specific shoutout
162,6,22,Michael, Stop talking
163,6,22,Andy, Ok As some of you may know I have a very special connection with Secretarys Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations But to me she is my girlfriend in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations So I wrote  a little ditty That I would like to play for all of you right now Its a little tune called Secretary of Love A one a two a one two three
164,6,22,Erin,  I know about Angela I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her Michael told me
165,6,22,Michael, Oh God
166,6,22,Andy, Can we talk about this in private
167,6,22,Erin, I dont want to be in private Is it true or is it not
168,6,22,Andy, Yes
169,6,22,Erin, Who else did you sleep with Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam Maybe all together
170,6,22,Pam, No no never
171,6,22,Erin, Did everyone know Was I the only one who didnt know
172,6,22,Dwight, Yeah pretty much
173,6,22,Erin, Who are you I dont know you 
174,6,22,Gabe, I should probably get involved in this but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue
175,6,22,Kevin, Erin you know if I had been engaged to anyone before you I wouldve told you
176,6,22,Erin, Thanks
177,6,22,Kevin, So if you need anything Im right over there
178,6,22,Pam,  Hey Erin You look delicious I mean beautiful
179,6,22,Gabe, Ok Ok there I heard that So Im sorry Pam but thats it Im going to have to suspend you without pay for two days
180,6,22,Pam, What What do you mean suspend me
181,6,22,Jim, I think you need to go a little easy You cant just suspend someone form work
182,6,22,Gabe, Yeah youre right You know what Um youre suspended too Jim  Ok fine You too Dwight
183,6,22,Dwight, Wait What I was just slowclapping your nononsense decisionmaking
184,6,22,Gabe, I dont want to hear it Suspended
185,6,22,Kevin, C is for suspension
186,6,22,Andy, Why would that be something to talk about on Secretarys Day
187,6,22,Michael, Andy shes not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with All right And besides who doesnt tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them Thats like thats like Mr and Mrs Smith crap
188,6,22,Andy, I was going to tell her just on my own time
189,6,22,Michael, You know what I resent the implication that I would keep that secret Everyone here knows that I cant and wont keep a secret
190,6,22,Andy, Who cares I mean its not like I klled someone Big deal right This can blow over in two seconds She never asked me So if you think about it I probably should have told her I guess Everybody does stupid things
191,6,22,Angela, Psst Hey Erin
192,6,22,Erin, You want to talk to me come to my desk
193,6,22,Angela, You embarrassed me earlier
194,6,22,Erin, Oh Take it up with the chief of police
195,6,22,Angela, You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy Its the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled I want to throw up just thinking about it
196,6,22,Erin, I want to throw up just thinking about it
197,6,22,Angela, You are throwing up for the wrong reasons
198,6,22,Toby,  I dont think this fax is going through Is there a different I can just put it through again you know
199,6,22,Pam, Hey You know I was engaged before Jim
200,6,22,Erin, Really
201,6,22,Pam, Yeah And he worked here too
202,6,22,Erin, It was Andy wasnt it
203,6,22,Pam, No no it wasnt Andy It wasnt It doesnt matter Its not about who youve been with Its about who you end up with Sometimes the heart doesnt know what it wants until it finds what it wants
204,6,22,Erin, I hope you find what youre looking for
205,6,22,Pam, Thank you 
206,6,22,Gabe,  So I can reprimand them but I cant suspend them Oh I cant do either Uh huh Fair enough
207,6,22,Pam,  Hey Toby
208,6,22,Toby, I called Tallahassee He can ask you not to come in but he cant dock your pay Thats not legal
209,6,22,Pam, Very interesting
210,6,22,Toby, Yeah I also learned some interesting things about how they structure
211,6,22,Pam,  Thanks Toby
212,6,22,Gabe, Hey everyone Hi Quite an afternoon huh Cathartic in a way Im glad I got to share it with you It makes you think about whats really important  Its not about showing youre in charge or flexing some sort of authority Its about forgiveness And yes Im talking about you three in this desk clump right here I think that if you were to apologize to me then I would revoke your suspension
213,6,22,Pam, I dont think an apology is enough I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension
214,6,22,Jim, And I got to take this bad attitude and I got to go home and I got to adjust it And I hope the suspension does that
215,6,22,Dwight,  Prideful idiots Watch how its done  Gabriel I apologize
216,6,22,Gabe, Great
217,6,22,Dwight,  I kneel before you
218,6,22,Gabe, Guys I would even take a contrite look as an apology
219,6,22,Dwight, Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition
220,6,22,Gabe,  Guys to err is human 
221,6,22,Erin, Trust is the most important thing to me Is your name Andy Bernard Whats your real name Lionel Frankenstein
222,6,22,Andy, Will you stop walking for one second Thats it Theres no other secrets Ok I mean yeah my chest is not naturally hairless and my parents pay my credit card bill
223,6,22,Erin, How long were you guys together

226,6,22,Andy, Yeah but thats it Now you know everything about me I promise And if I think of anything else

228,6,22,Andy, I didnt see that movie
229,6,22,Gabe,  That was ugly Im sorry you had to see that
230,6,22,Kelly, Do they still get paid
231,6,22,Gabe, Its tacky to discuss finances Its best to pretend that this never happened
232,6,22,Oscar, Sounds like they just got to go home with pay
233,6,22,Meredith, Pathetic
234,6,22,Gabe, Can I buy everyone coffees   Or cookies
235,6,22,Dwight, What was that Are you kidding me Was that an impression
236,6,22,Gabe, Alright
237,6,22,Kevin,  Uh guys Im now going to apologize for the mess that were in because corporate told me to I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person
238,6,22,Gabe, You got to be able to laugh at yourself Im one of the gang
239,6,22,Dwight, I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit
240,6,22,Kevin, Ciao Right Ciao I say Ciao because Im fancy from Tallahassee

255,6,22,Oscar's voice from the computer, Hey Kevin its Oscar Im looking at the sheet you sent me And I cant seem to find the column for shipping cost
256,6,22,Kevin, I made the most brilliant retaliation video Its awesome

1,6,23,Erin, Buenos dias Miguel  Hello DunderMifflin
2,6,23,Michael, No no no no Solamente en espanol por favor
3,6,23,Michael, I believe that every man woman and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish They are our neighbors to the South and this would be a healing thing for for all of North America And I am going on vacation next week to Cancun
4,6,23,Michael, Buenos dias Jaime
5,6,23,Jim, Buenos dias Miguel Como estas Bien Claro que si Yo estoy fantastico Que pasa
6,6,23,Michael, Ha ha Buenos dias Dwight
7,6,23,Dwight, Guten tag Herr Michael
8,6,23,Dwight, I dont understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish I have it on very good authority that within 20 years everyone will be speaking German Or a ChineseGerman hybrid
9,6,23,Michael, La telefona
10,6,23,Oscar, El telefono
11,6,23,Oscar, Michaels having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender And um  I should have been more specific
12,6,23,Oscar, Your office is full of genitalia
13,6,23,Michael,  Oh Eso es lo que dice el
14,6,23,Oscar, Thats what he says
15,6,23,Michael, Damn it  Ah Angelo

22,6,23,Michael, Can you smell the power of the Halperts Power couple
23,6,23,Dwight, You know what I should be getting this client Michael My numbers are better than either of theirs
24,6,23,Michael, I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company
25,6,23,Dwight, If you want people to put the best face on something why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives
26,6,23,Jim,  Thats a good point
27,6,23,Pam, This is our first joint sales pitch I think were gonna work really well together

46,6,23,Angela, I knew it You should see their baby
47,6,23,Jim,  So yes laser printers are more expensive But they cost less to operate  So its a tradeoff

55,6,23,Donna, Oh yeah thank you
56,6,23,Michael, Okay I have more of them
57,6,23,Gabe, You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate A twoweek training program at the Yale school of management obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities
58,6,23,Darryl, Sounds all right
59,6,23,Dwight, What is this
60,6,23,Gabe, Oh this is Print in All Colors Sabres minority executive training program
61,6,23,Dwight, It doesnt just sound aight it sounds amazing
62,6,23,Darryl, I didnt say aight
63,6,23,Dwight, How do I apply
64,6,23,Gabe, You have to be a minority
65,6,23,Dwight, Uh glasses wearers Cholera survivors Geniuses Nonorganic family farmers The list goes on and on You want me to keep going

72,6,23,Dwight, One minority from this branch is going to get into this program Who would I refer Hmm the competent hardworking one who does things his own way or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines

77,6,23,Kelly, Yeah
78,6,23,Dwight, I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot just because of your race
79,6,23,Kelly, Well they say its because of texting but maybe youre right
80,6,23,Dwight, I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program
81,6,23,Kelly, Never thought of myself as an executive before
82,6,23,Dwight, I know cause you have no role models How many Indian CEOs can you think of
83,6,23,Kelly, I cant think of any CEOs any race
84,6,23,Dwight, You could be the Indian Bill Gates You could be the Indian Ted Turner
85,6,23,Kelly, I could be the Indian Julia Roberts
86,6,23,Dwight, Thats not shes okay Yes
87,6,23,Michael, I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier and I want to show you there we go  Whoa look at those vivid colors Look at my eyes Those are Shrekgreen eyes That is me again I think this displays the crisp dazzling white
88,6,23,Donna, Mmhmm
89,6,23,Michael, And that would be a display  of the crisp gorgeous black
90,6,23,Donna, Yeah
91,6,23,Michael, Its subtle Thats how it works I show her an image that turns her on And then she looks at me then back at me then back at the image Soon she doesnt know what is me what is the image She just knows that shes turned on
92,6,23,Michael, This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts Ive never taken anybody there before
93,6,23,Donna, Who took the photo
94,6,23,Michael, Ryan
95,6,23,Donna, Oh 
96,6,23,Michael, And thats it Thats me Thats who I am
97,6,23,Donna,  Not bad
98,6,23,Michael, Oh thanks  Youre not bad either
99,6,23,Donna, Thank you  Hmm
100,6,23,Michael, Hmm
101,6,23,Donna, Oh my God 
102,6,23,Michael, Jim Could you come in here for a sec What was that printer we were looking at
103,6,23,Michael,  You didnt see it Pam She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move Shortbread
104,6,23,Jim, No
105,6,23,Pam, Ill have one
106,6,23,Jim, Well maybe you shouldnt try to kiss people at work
107,6,23,Michael, Oh really Jim What about Pam And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss Maybe this could be my Pam
108,6,23,Jim, Okay Well all that is irrelevant
109,6,23,Pam, Maybe Michael has a point I mean if she was really that upset she wouldnt still be here
110,6,23,Donna, Was it professional No But I work in the nightlife industry I get hit on all the time In my 20s it would have been annoying In my late 20s I find it really flattering
111,6,23,Michael, Look I know that I screwed up in there I know that I probably messed up your sale I just want to go in and fix it
112,6,23,Pam, What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim
113,6,23,Jim, What
114,6,23,Jim, What was that
115,6,23,Pam, Just let him flirt with her People meet each other all sorts of ways
116,6,23,Jim, Pam you know hes not gonna get anywhere and hes gonna blow our sale
117,6,23,Pam, Who cares  Its not that huge a sale
118,6,23,Jim, Hey the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale
119,6,23,Pam, Dont act like you understood anything that guy said  Good luck wingman 
120,6,23,Dwight, How as being a minority affected you
121,6,23,Kelly, Well theres a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy
122,6,23,Dwight, Oh good and you resent this because
123,6,23,Kelly, Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants Its so dorky
124,6,23,Dwight, Oh no no Thats not dorky  Look its easily accessible Boom like this 911 hello Scranton Stranglers in the house Inside the house
125,6,23,Kelly, Just put it in your pocket
126,6,23,Michael and Donna, 
127,6,23,Kevin,  Look at that Shes totally flirting with him
128,6,23,Phyllis, You dont know that Some people cant help oozing sexuality
129,6,23,Creed, sexuality and pus Man I tell ya
130,6,23,Phyllis, She just crossed her arms together thats bad
131,6,23,Pam, Maybe shes just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger
132,6,23,Kevin,  Like that 
133,6,23,Donna, Is this is this the best you can do right there
134,6,23,Jim, Uh for that printer yes Unfortunately we dont have a lot of flexibility
135,6,23,Donna, Oh Well I guess Im just used to the restaurant business  where if youre in charge then you can always get discounts for the people that you like
136,6,23,Jim, Yeah 
137,6,23,Michael, So maybe we could find a little wiggle room right
138,6,23,Jim, Whats that
139,6,23,Michael, Maybe wee find some wiggle room
140,6,23,Jim, I dont I dont think so
141,6,23,Michael, I think we could 
142,6,23,Oscar, I dont see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money Delivery alone will cost
143,6,23,Michael, Okay well sometimes sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money right Like for tax purposes
144,6,23,Oscar, Actually ran the numbers on this and in this case it makes more financial sense to gain money
145,6,23,Michael, Why dont you run them again
146,6,23,Jim, What if shes just flirting with you to get a better price
147,6,23,Michael, If she is its working
148,6,23,Kevin, Yeah Michael heres a trick Ask her if she wants a mint If she says no then she is not interested
149,6,23,Jim, She does not like him
150,6,23,Pam, You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them How do you think we got together
151,6,23,Jim, cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day
152,6,23,Pam, I was after your money
153,6,23,Jim, Well the joke was on you
154,6,23,Pam, Yes it was
155,6,23,Kelly,  Can you stop micromanaging I know how to do this
156,6,23,Ryan, Okay
157,6,23,Dwight, Hey what are you guys doing
158,6,23,Kelly, This girl was really rude to me at the mall So I created a fake IM account from a hot guy at her high school and now Im trying to make her anorexic
159,6,23,Ryan, Tell her everyone in home room thinks shes fat
160,6,23,Kelly, Oh that is so good
161,6,23,Dwight, You know we really should keep practicing for this interview
162,6,23,Kelly, Oh thats okay Ryan coached me
163,6,23,Dwight, Ryan What does he know
164,6,23,Ryan, Its easy you just turn every question around on them Do you think youre treated differently because of your race
165,6,23,Kelly, Would you ask that same question if I was white Were so in
166,6,23,Dwight, We
167,6,23,Kelly, When I become executive Im gonna make Ryan manager
168,6,23,Ryan, And then the two of us are cleanin house
169,6,23,Dwight, Kelly will be even worse than Darryl If youd have told me this morning that today Id be creating a monster capable f my own destruction I d have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate
170,6,23,Michael, So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller

199,6,23,Jim, What
200,6,23,Pam, Im not saying shes in love with him But she could have left a while ago Most printer sales are done over the phone Ms Boob shirt

159,6,25,Jim, Excellent Go for it
160,6,25,Gabe, Im sure you got my email about the printer fires The one with the branching decision tree I actually designed that chart Kinda hoping it catches on  Anyway the question is what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way
161,6,25,Jim, Right So uh lets uh
162,6,25,Lawyer, Finally theres a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man a la Benjamin Button
163,6,25,Angela, Same page Go to the next one
164,6,25,Dwight, Same page Just keep moving
165,6,25,Lawyer, Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix
166,6,25,Dwight, Which we cant know
167,6,25,Lawyer, This is essentially
168,6,25,Dwight, Unless were unplugged
169,6,25,Lawyer, Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor
170,6,25,Dwight, And wake up in the future
171,6,25,Lawyer, Which is actually pretty common So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract
172,6,25,Dwight, What
173,6,25,Lawyer, Look I cant enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else
174,6,25,Angela, What
175,6,25,Lawyer, So essentially this comes down to damages Now there is some precedence for the range of 30000
176,6,25,Dwight, What
177,6,25,Dwight, I dont have 30000 lying around I have it buried very deeply and I dont want to dig past a certain someone to get it
178,6,25,Andy, Chase Dixon is up Could be a big play
179,6,25,Michael, You have no idea what youre talking about
180,6,25,Andy, I know its like cricket

184,6,25,Andy, Seems pretty well liked by the team
185,6,25,Michael, Okay well thats because hes paying their salary
186,6,25,Andy, You do know that high school coaches dont pay their players
187,6,25,Michael, I know I know I know ItImit that was a euphemism
188,6,25,Dwight, 30000 Theres gotta be another way
189,6,25,Angela, He has a 60acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune
190,6,25,Dwight, Look I will not pay
191,6,25,Angela, Well I have an alternative
192,6,25,Dwight, Intercourse to completion Five individual times rendered at my discretion
193,6,25,Lawyer, Look I dont think thats actually legal
194,6,25,Dwight, Agreed 
195,6,25,Dwight, Five times for 30000 Not a bad stud fee Better than most horses
196,6,25,Dwight, But not in your bed Its lumpy
197,6,25,Angela, Those lumps are cats and those cats have names and those names are Ember Milky Way Diane and Lumpy
198,6,25,Dwight, Fine Five times 
199,6,25,Lawyer, Look I cant legally watch this unfold Its coming a little dangerously close to prostitution
200,6,25,Angela, I want eye contact
201,6,25,Dwight, No
202,6,25,Angela, Yes
203,6,25,Dwight, Do you understand how rare is that in nature

64,6,26,Jo, Yeah I noticed youve had a great year Good boy you turning that money into more money
65,6,26,Dwight, Are you referring to alchemy

96,6,26,Toby, Oh uh I dont know uh
97,6,26,Jo, The way I look at it theres only one of two reasons He knows a secret about her that she doesnt know herself or he wants to use her services to mop up after a mrder

76,7,1,Michael, To get some ice cream for everybody Its national ice cream afternoon Great
77,7,1,Michael, And another thing I did this summer I hired my nephew
78,7,1,Michael, Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me because his mother who also happens to be my halfsister kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a 14 The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of Ace Ventura II and that was 95 so yes 15 years on the dot Anyway I lost him in a forest
79,7,1,Michael, Dont bother Luke
80,7,1,Pam, Why is there a circle with a line through it
81,7,1,Michael, That means dont Havent you seen Ghostbusters Pam

86,7,1,Phyllis, Hey why cant we bother Luke He deserves it
87,7,1,Michael, Because I dont want it getting back to Sabre that were yelling at assistants I think it would reflect poorly on us
88,7,1,Dwight, Whos gonna tell on us Gabe
89,7,1,Gabe, Thatd be hilarious Uh Jo theyre creating a hostile work environment Stop em
90,7,1,Michael, Nope it wont be Gabe but actually there is somebody in the office that is very very close to Luke
91,7,1,Dwight, How close
92,7,1,Michael, Well Dwight he wiped his butt Is that close enough for you

98,7,1,Oscar, Michael thats nepotism Luke is getting special treatment because hes your nephew
99,7,1,Michael, Yes exactly That is a very nice way of putting it Oscar Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing
100,7,1,Darryl, Whats wrong with a level playing field
101,7,1,Michael, Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson What if no one named Hanson showed up That wouldnt even make sense Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50yearold guy who was a mrderr Really safe
102,7,1,Jim, Oh man so many points being made
103,7,1,Creed, I couldnt care less about nepotism But Im loving the debate Great minds battling it out And Ive got a front row seat
104,7,1,Michael, God when he needed help on Earth who did he hire Jesus Christ his son
105,7,1,Erin, Thats a really tight argument
106,7,1,Michael, Thank you
107,7,1,Jim, But youre comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus
108,7,1,Michael, No No Im just saying why does God get to do something that I dont
109,7,1,Oscar, This is hypothetical Were talking about Luke who happens to be terrible
110,7,1,Michael, Well then why arent you bugging me to fire everybody whos bad You just want me to fire Luke Thats reverse nepotism He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does
111,7,1,Kelly, I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field That is actually a zoning issue So thank you
112,7,1,Oscar, If theres nothing wrong with this Michael why have you been keeping it a secret
113,7,1,Michael, Because I wanted you to come to me and say Wow he is so great And I was gonna say Well its in the genes And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans And Id point to them right No But you ruined it So thank you very much Here he comes Guys look I dont want you to treat him like anyone else in the office I just want you to treat him like my nephew Hey there he is

128,7,1,Michael, All right those might be his He might own an Ebay store
129,7,1,Jim, Yep Thats exactly what my first thought was And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like I dont own an Ebay store so
130,7,1,Michael, Ok ok You know what This is disgusting This is like a witch hunt This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project
131,7,1,Oscar, Oh sure those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday
132,7,1,Stanley, Lets just make this kid open this damn car
133,7,1,Erin, Oh my gosh those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots

34,7,2,Toby, Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional I actually have a degree in social work I mean I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions and check off a few boxes but Ive got a chance to do some good here
35,7,2,Michael, I know what you want to ask me Did your mom ever see you naked
36,7,2,Toby, We can do this with more privacy
37,7,2,Michael, So you can molest me Oh ok I dont think so Were going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are Thats the key
38,7,2,Dwight, Boycott the Steamtown Mall Everyone you heard me Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall
39,7,2,Phyllis, The mall itself or just the stores in the mall
40,7,2,Dwight, All of it The mall the stores the kiosks

52,7,2,Pam, Tell me Im good at sales
53,7,2,Jim, Youre good youre good at sales
54,7,2,Pam, The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission So you suck at sales you make almost no money I guess thats fair
55,7,2,Andy, Dwight
56,7,2,Dwight, What
57,7,2,Andy, Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the F word
58,7,2,Dwight, Yes I did And Im going to do the same with all of your clients

63,7,2,Jim, Ok
64,7,2,Dwight, You guys know me You know that Im not one for fancy things but there was this one thing It was in a fancy store And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the RiteAid And I thought you know maybe I deserve this You know I had a great crop yield this fall
65,7,2,Pam, So what happened
66,7,2,Dwight, I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer and they looked right at me and then they looked away And then I pressed the buzzer again and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones I guess Im not the kind of guy thats good enough for precious heirlooms
67,7,2,Kelly, You know what Dwight You need to go back there and you need to Pretty Woman their asses
68,7,2,Creed, We should start our own mall
69,7,2,Erin, Yeah
70,7,2,Jim, Wait wait wait Thats actually a really good idea Kelly
71,7,2,Kelly, What did I say
72,7,2,Kelly, I talk a lot so Ive learned to just tune myself out
73,7,2,Jim, Dwight how about this Instead of boycotting you and I together go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson
74,7,2,Andy, No you and I and I Im going to come with you
75,7,2,Dwight, Ok
76,7,2,Jim, Alright

86,7,2,Toby, Tell me
87,7,2,Toby, I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere
88,7,2,Michael, Yes I will I will talk alright Be careful what you wish for Toby
89,7,2,Dwight, Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980s Beautiful Girl
90,7,2,Andy, Pretty Woman
91,7,2,Dwight, Apparently its one of the best revenge stories of all times in which this sx worker who is the antagonist That cant be right Andy How does it
92,7,2,Jim, No no I want to hear you tell it
93,7,2,Dwight, Ok Um The sx worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy She later returns dressed in all the trappings of extravagant wealth but instead of going

154,7,2,Pam, Yes Absolutely Right away
155,7,2,Toby, You know what Michael Youre right You win This is pointless Were not getting anywhere I got a bunch of fun stuff in case my daughter ever comes over Why dont we just run out the clock by playing games drawing some pictures talking

162,7,2,Erin, Disposable cameras are fun although it does seem wasteful and you dont ever get to see your pictures If its an important even that you want to remember I recommend using a real camera But I dont care if I forget today
163,7,2,Toby, We can play something more complicated if you like
164,7,2,Michael, This is plenty complicated
165,7,2,Toby, So you have played it before
166,7,2,Michael, Ive played it once or twice with Jeff
167,7,2,Toby, Whos Jeff
168,7,2,Michael, Jeff was my mothers boyfriend who she married
169,7,2,Toby, So her husband your stepdad
170,7,2,Michael, Yeah Yeah I guess I never thought about it that way though
171,7,2,Toby, Did you guys do much stuff together
172,7,2,Michael, Yeah You know what He took me to a baseball game once I remember It was weird though They took the pitcher out of the game I felt really bad because the pitcher wasnt able to play with his friends anymore But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move by taking the pitcher out He really respected the manager
173,7,2,Toby, Its working Im doing it

179,7,2,Toby, Its really sad that your dog ran away Why did it keep you from going to the park
180,7,2,Michael, I was afraid I would find him in the park playing with another kid
181,7,2,Toby, Why
182,7,2,Michael, I guess thats why I thought he ran away in the first place To find a kid he liked better
183,7,2,Toby, Dogs dont do that
184,7,2,Michael, Right Why would a dog do that Thats silly
185,7,2,Toby, I dont know
186,7,2,Michael, When I hear myself say it it sounds ridiculous But Ive never said it out loud so
187,7,2,Toby, Its very important for you to be liked isnt it
188,7,2,Michael, Well lets not get too This isnt a counseling session Ok Son of a gn Son of a bitch Wow Ok
189,7,2,Toby, Im just trying to help you Michael
190,7,2,Michael, You Bitch God Youre very helpful arent you You try to help everybody Do you want to play another game

197,7,2,Pam, Hey Michael um about three months ago I was talking to 
198,7,2,Pam, There are a lot of one person departments here so theres a lot of department heads But Im off to a good start Oh man If I could pull this off it will be scam of all scams And yet very helpful to everyone
199,7,2,Gabe, So Corporate got your evaluations and they want me to check is that really how you feel about Michaels situation
200,7,2,Toby, Yes
201,7,2,Gabe, That is not how it seems to me
202,7,2,Toby, He seems fine
203,7,2,Gabe, You marked severe in all the categories including at risk for homicidal behavior
204,7,2,Toby, Heh

207,7,2,Darryl, Right in here
208,7,2,Pam, Easily
209,7,2,Gabe, Im back Ha ha Pam perfect I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem
210,7,2,Pam, But of course
211,7,2,Gabe, Great
212,7,2,Gabe, The problem unfortunately is about the office administrator I have gone through everything for the past three years There is nothing that says you are the office administrator
213,7,2,Pam, So weird that there is no paperwork
214,7,2,Gabe, At all
215,7,2,Pam, Although like unlikely things happen all the time My best friend in High School she went to Australia Canberra I think and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America
216,7,2,Gabe, Pam I dont want to accuse you of anything I just want everything to be back the way its supposed to be Can you just admit admit
217,7,2,Pam, Admit what
218,7,2,Gabe, I dont want to say it
219,7,2,Pam, Say it
220,7,2,Gabe, Mmhmm
221,7,2,Pam, Say that Im lying or say that I have the job Make a definitive statement Gabe
222,7,2,Gabe, Statements of such nature while they have their place are overused in a competitive business environment
223,7,2,Pam, Great Well Let me know if you need a new chair or anything that an Office Administrator can handle
224,7,2,Gabe, Will do Can I get one of those name plates that says Gabe Lewis

135,7,3,Jim, Okay this was pretty simple
136,7,3,Pam, Why are you here
137,7,3,Jim,  Really all you had to do was play with her for like 30 minutes and then put her to bed
138,7,3,Pam, What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here I dont you know babies shouldnt have ice cream by the way
139,7,3,Erin, Im sorry I just really wanted to see Andy You guys made it sound so unmissable and you set me up with a car seat and everything
140,7,3,Jim, Well the car seat was to take her to the hospital or
141,7,3,Erin, Oh no why would I take her to the hospital
142,7,3,Pam, You know what It doesnt matter It doesnt matter

86,7,4,Dwight, Then I will
87,7,4,Michael,

110,7,4,Andy, No thats
111,7,4,Oscar, Andy the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyones attention and it seems like youve done it on several occasions

113,7,4,Phyllis, Oh When you got your new phone thats when you asked for everyones attention

263,7,4,Carroll, You didnt call my office and ask where I was

272,7,4,Gabe, I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out You said and I quote My good sir Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way
273,7,4,Andy, The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely It was very difficult for me to say no
274,7,4,Gabe, Ill let this slide but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you
275,7,4,Michael, Oh wow another living room

257,7,6,Michael, Stop it Stop stop Were thinking Were thinking about it
258,7,6,Gabe, Yeah
259,7,6,Michael, You dont have to point to the fact that were thinking about it Stop it Just let us think Okay next time you have a really great idea we will put it in a hat and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide
260,7,6,Darryl, I dont understand the point of a hat
261,7,6,Gabe, Youre right we dont need a hat
262,7,6,Michael, I am not budging on the hat issue
263,7,6,Gabe, Okay Were going to table the hat question The best ideas are going to come to me I make the final decision period
264,7,6,Michael, Okay We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe
265,7,6,Gabe, Okay why dont we simplify this Darryl brings it to Michael Michael brings it to me no one calls Jo
266,7,6,Michael, Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo then well give her a call
267,7,6,Darryl, Cool Okay Sorry I lied
268,7,6,Michael, Sorry I was a jerk
269,7,6,Michael, Friends fight Friends fight
270,7,6,Andy, Whats up man
271,7,6,Darryl, Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse you know
272,7,6,Andy, When I was a freshman in college I worked at the student newspaper the Cornell Daily Sun This was at Cornell I had to write an oped column every day Bernards Regards
273,7,6,Darryl, This was your freshman year
274,7,6,Andy, I started to ask myself Do I have big plans here I didnt want to become editor of that paper so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall and thats actually when I heard eight male voices singing unencumbered by instruments I was hooked So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group Come on were going to Dannys bar Public School
275,7,6,Darryl, No I got some work to do I do got big plans with this company
276,7,6,Jim, To be honest I still cant believe he didnt call her back Who doesnt call a dork like that back
277,7,6,Pam, Oh wow
278,7,6,Jim,  Spinach in a can Power eat spinach 
279,7,6,Pam, Aww my hero
280,7,6,Pam, Okay everyone Ive tallied the votes and the winner of the costume celebration spectacular and the Scranton WilkesBarre coupon book Oscar Martinez
281,7,6,Kelly, If I have to vote for someone I dont want it to be someone who can beat me
282,7,6,Ryan, Shake things up Im a Nader guy
283,7,6,Creed, Best Edward James Olmos costume Ive ever seen Like freaky good
0,7,7,Pam, I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately Its that time of year And according to a study done by the University of Arizona theyve discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat
1,7,7,Kelly, I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat
2,7,7,Michael, Thats true thats true I dated her momma and you know what
3,7,7,Jim, Stop
4,7,7,Michael,  Um kay Uh alright
5,7,7,Pam, One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough
6,7,7,Erin, DiDid you say vampire
7,7,7,Pam, Oh no its just that if a vampire had to cough he would do it like this 
8,7,7,Dwight, Uhhuh Right And ruin their cloaks Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania  Cause of the euro
9,7,7,Pam, Well other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly Dont come in if youre sick
10,7,7,Dwight,  Uh
11,7,7,Pam, And get your flu shot Also Im going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office
12,7,7,Dwight, NO no no They will cost you your life
13,7,7,Jim, Elaborate
14,7,7,Dwight, The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it They need to fight their own battles If Sabre really cared about our wellbeing they would set up hand desanitizing stations A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt vomit fecal matter
15,7,7,Pam, Im not  Im not going to do that Im not going to do that
16,7,7,Dwight, Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger
17,7,7,Jim, So by that rationale if I had to sneeze I should just sneeze on you
18,7,7,Dwight, Yes I would welcome it
19,7,7,Jim,  Youre welcome
20,7,7,Dwight, The principle is sound To avoid illness expose yourself to germs enabling your immune system to develop antibodies I dont know why everyone doesnt do this Maybe they have something against living forever
21,7,7,Angela, Jim Pam  And the precious bundle of Gods gift to everything  I wish you both a pleasant day  And you too Yes Praise God Ok
22,7,7,Pam, Ceces getting christened today

29,7,7,Michael, Oh yes  Doobiedoobie doo
30,7,7,Michael, I invited everyone in the office because its not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me It is about us all And I thought we should all celebrate my joy And our all of ours joys

58,7,9,Ryan, New Investors are key though Thats actually why I came in today
59,7,9,Michael, Dont you work here fulltime
60,7,9,Ryan,  Today I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who havent invested yet
61,7,9,Michael, MmHmm
62,7,9,Ryan, Or we could do that together if that sounds fun to you
63,7,9,Michael, That does sound fun to me
64,7,9,Ryan, Awesome
65,7,9,Dwight,  Ah this is good hay Yeah This is the good stuff mattress quality
66,7,9,Dwight, Every fall my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in We called it Hay Place Eldred Called it Hay World Eventually lawyers were brought in But thats all behind us Hay Place lives on  Watch it watch it
67,7,9,Dwight, Hello Welcome to Hay Place A place for hay

73,7,9,Dwight, Oh our contract
74,7,9,Angela, MmHmm

78,7,9,Jim,  All right Thank you I willI will send the contracts over right away All Right  Whoo 
79,7,9,Jim, I am on the first hot sale streak of my life I think it all comes from feeding Cece because no matter how much she resists I sell her those carrots Lets be honestif I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob I can pretty much sell anything 
80,7,9,Kevin, Commission comes out to dunhduhnadah Zero
81,7,9,Jim, MmKay Well it cant be zero Kev
82,7,9,Kevin, I entered the sale and I hit enter and I said dunhduhnadah Im pretty sure I timesed it right

86,7,9,Kevin, Dunhduhnadah
87,7,9,Gabe, Is this job really about the money for you Jim I mean isnt this where you fell in love
88,7,9,Jim, A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell So you realize I now have no reason to work right
89,7,9,Gabe, When youre dealing with a large organization sometimes you have to put up with policies you dont like I wish my gym didnt allow full nudity in the locker room Okay seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passiveaggressive But I deal with it Cause its policy See what I mean
90,7,9,Jim, Nope
91,7,9,Gabe, Nudity makes me uncomfortable
92,7,9,Jim, Okay
93,7,9,Gabe, My gym allows it I wish they didnt but its policy So I respect it and I just keep a lowyou know I look away Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room

248,7,10,Dwight, Yeah but Im still an employee here and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery Whats the square footage in the new place

255,7,10,Pam, Mmhmm
256,7,10,Pam, I lied about some aspects of the building
257,7,10,Jim, Its still on a bike path though right
258,7,10,Pam, Theres no building it doesnt exist
259,7,10,Jim, What does that mean
260,7,10,Pam, I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet Its just this Office Administrator thing I dont wanna
261,7,10,Jim, What
262,7,10,Pam, Fail I dont want to fail again
263,7,10,Jim, But you didnt fail
264,7,10,Pam, And thats what you said about Art School and thats what you said about sales
265,7,10,Jim, And you didnt fail those things either
266,7,10,Pam, Well Im not an artist and Im not a salesman So what would you call it
267,7,10,Jim, Hey hey hey hey hey
268,7,10,Oscar, Michael the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that Ive been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated
269,7,10,Michael, Did you know that China has a new missile that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast
270,7,10,Oscar, We have missiles too
271,7,10,Michael, Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal But what do I know I mean thats just according to the Pentagon Our Pentagon
272,7,10,Nate, I wasnt here 
273,7,10,Pam, What
274,7,10,Nate, I wasnt here Its a pretty common saying You may want to log it away for future use
275,7,10,Pam, Well thanks
276,7,10,Nate, Yeah
277,7,10,Michael, China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives And they will control us
278,7,10,Oscar, Actually were in a mild recession right now Ill give you that but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems In the nineteen eighties it was Japan
279,7,10,Michael, How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17 and in the US it has only risen by 8
280,7,10,Oscar, Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economys heading in 2011 Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector Id say thats far more relevant Wouldnt you
281,7,10,Michael, Dont I
282,7,10,Pam, Hello hello Youre breaking the law
283,7,10,Dwight, Impossible I love the law
284,7,10,Pam, Read article nineteen There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting It also means no more cutting the tampons in two and no more tampering with the toilet paper
285,7,10,Dwight, I see Ive underestimated you and I didnt think that was possible Nate reply the paper
286,7,10,Nate, I dont think it goes that way
287,7,10,Dwight, Reply it
288,7,10,Oscar, Dont worry about the coffee its on me
289,7,10,Michael, Yeah I figured that
290,7,10,Oscar, Michael I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat
291,7,10,Michael, Wait You forgetting something
292,7,10,Oscar, What

295,7,10,Michael, Here we are
296,7,10,Oscar, Whats your point
297,7,10,Michael, My point is that as long as people like you and me dont stop talking nobody can stop the USA
298,7,10,Andy, Yeah 
299,7,10,Erin, Right yes
300,7,10,Michael, I am talking about freedom about choice America I dont think you need to worry Because if you want to beat China you will If you dont thats fine That my friend is your victory Yknow a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China and that may be the true but what they dont tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation you get to a friend So here is to conversation
301,7,10,Oscar, Thats not
302,7,10,Michael, Raise your cups on high Case closed
303,7,10,Oscar, That wasnt what we were discu That wasnt the whole
304,7,10,Dwight, They say the best vampires dont bleed their victims dry but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again I spared Pam and I may feast off of her profits for years to come I let Pam win Haha oh I was not motivated by compassion I have no compassion Make sure you got that Not motivated by compassion

184,7,12-Nov,Kevin, I would but I dont want to get dirty There might be girls at the party

302,7,12-Nov,Pam, Well Darryl no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents
303,7,12-Nov,Darryl, Her mom wants me to take her to mass I guess thats something to do
304,7,12-Nov,Pam, No you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas
305,7,12-Nov,Darryl, How do I do that
306,7,12-Nov,Pam, Bring her to the party Yeah well have Santa and well play games with her Itll be a lot of fun

317,7,12-Nov,Darryl, No he doesnt  I told her Santa would be here
318,7,12-Nov,Michael, Yeah well I was told that Holly would be here single and ready to date And we all got misled
319,7,12-Nov,Pam, Who told you that
320,7,12-Nov,Michael, Nora Ephron in every romantic comedy ever made

326,7,12-Nov,Pam, Kelly Um how are you adjusting to the move
327,7,12-Nov,Phyllis, Nobody cares about that Look you have to make him commit or kick his butt to the curb
328,7,12-Nov,Pam, You guys I dont think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life
329,7,12-Nov,Erin, Yeah I mean maybe Hollys not in any position to be shooing guys away
330,7,12-Nov,Erin, I dont get it Im sorry I just I dont get it
331,7,12-Nov,Holly, Okay listen Im gonna tell him that if he doesnt propose by the end of this year were over

369,7,12-Nov,Angela, Its so cold Even with my coat on
370,7,12-Nov,Meredith, Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car for screwing Americans
371,7,12-Nov,Gabe, Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy
372,7,12-Nov,Holly, You guys this has to stop Someone could have really gotten hurt
373,7,12-Nov,Michael, What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window You know what would have happened The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off And yes it might have been funny But it also would have been incredibly tragic
374,7,12-Nov,Dwight, I could not agree more And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress
375,7,12-Nov,Jim, What are you talking about Youre the one terrorizing me
376,7,12-Nov,Dwight, With snowballs Jim With fluffy little snowballs No I thought we were just playing
377,7,12-Nov,Holly, Dwights right What you did was dangerous and inappropriate Im really surprised at you guys Last time I was here you were both best friends
378,7,12-Nov,Michael, All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story You see this on my desk  Know who gave me this My girlfriend Tara who lives in New York City
379,7,12-Nov,Dwight, Wait what girlfriend
380,7,12-Nov,Michael, I havent told you about her
381,7,12-Nov,Dwight, I find that unlikely You email me when you get a new zit
382,7,12-Nov,Michael, Im a man in my mid40s and I still get zits I think thats pretty interesting But you know what I am not on trial here The Scranton strangler is So anyway we have this great weekend and she drives me to the airport and we get to JFK but I am flying out of LaGuardia So we laugh and laugh and laugh and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slomo drinking latte And at the end of the day she gives me this and she says Michael maybe next time you should take a cab
383,7,12-Nov,Holly, I didnt know you had a girlfriend
384,7,12-Nov,Michael, I do She is
385,7,12-Nov,Michael, Did you see her face Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G Scott And it aint Tara
386,7,12-Nov,Phyllis, So you went homemade this year
387,7,12-Nov,Pam, Yup
388,7,12-Nov,Phyllis, Yeah Money problems is that what this is about I mean oh dear I dont think we can help you out
389,7,12-Nov,Pam, No no Jim had a great year actually I just wanted to get your opinion
390,7,12-Nov,Phyllis, Are you good at homemade
391,7,12-Nov,Pam, Look at this
392,7,12-Nov,Phyllis, Yeah
393,7,12-Nov,Holly,  Who did this Its obvious to me Im not welcome here but somebody better tell me who did this or else Im leaving
394,7,12-Nov,Phyllis, Well I dont think Erin seems to like you
395,7,12-Nov,Erin, Thats not true I dont know her enough to make a decision even
396,7,12-Nov,Michael, What happened What happened Toby what did you do I think Tobys very jealous of all the attention youve been getting
397,7,12-Nov,Toby, No I would never ever do anything like that But it does seem like something you would do
398,7,12-Nov,Michael, Oh really Turn it on me Well isnt that nice Thank you very much
399,7,12-Nov,Kevin, Wait wait guys listen Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people arent looking You dont think its not possible that Woody did this to himself
400,7,12-Nov,Michael, It is Christmas
401,7,12-Nov,Angela, No it really seems like something Michael would do
402,7,12-Nov,Michael, Mmhmm Mmhmm Well the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me And that I have been framed
403,7,12-Nov,Andy, Why would anyone frame you for that
404,7,12-Nov,Jim, Okay Im sorry why are we discounting this whole Woody came to life thing so quickly
405,7,12-Nov,Michael, Ahhhhhh  Surprise It was part of the party Pretty funny huh
406,7,12-Nov,Holly, You think this is funny
407,7,12-Nov,Michael,  I dont But someday I think we will laugh about this when we tell our kids
408,7,12-Nov,Jim, Yikes 
409,7,12-Nov,Kevin, Oh no thats thats not happening
410,7,12-Nov,Dwight, Dear God in heaven
411,7,12-Nov,Michael, All right Shh Okay you know what Holly I didnt mean to do it It was an accident An accident borne of jealous feelings
412,7,12-Nov,Holly, Michael you have to let this go Im with someone else I dont feel that way anymore
413,7,12-Nov,Michael, Oh really You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend Thats what Jim and Dwight thought
414,7,12-Nov,Dwight, Okay hey hey hey
415,7,12-Nov,Jim, No fake girlfriends are always wrong
416,7,12-Nov,Holly, You made up a fake girlfriend to see if Id get jealous And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me What is the matter with you
417,7,12-Nov,Michael, When you got transferred and I drove you up to Nashua you said Michael I love you but I cant do this But then with this other guy you dont have any problem with a longdistance relationship do you And you know what that is what is the matter with me
418,7,12-Nov,Holly, Michael Im sorry
419,7,12-Nov,Michael, And we did this whole stupid party for you
420,7,12-Nov,Erin,  No
421,7,12-Nov,Holly, You guys it wasnt my fault
422,7,12-Nov,Kevin, Oh nothing is ever your fault Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us
423,7,12-Nov,Erin, I really think youre better off
424,7,12-Nov,Michael, Mmm Erin would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me please
425,7,12-Nov,Erin, Yeah Is she an amazing cook or something
426,7,12-Nov,Jim,  Hey Pickles Merry Christmas Open immediately Love Swiss Cheese  Damn it Dwight
427,7,12-Nov,Dwight, Didnt think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing did you Jim Let that be a lesson to you all
428,7,12-Nov,Stanley, So do they bring in food or do you get to go out
429,7,12-Nov,Toby, No they bring it in
430,7,12-Nov,Stanley, You lucky son of a bitch
431,7,12-Nov,Stanley, I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old To get to go sit in an airconditioned room downtown judging people while my lunch is paid for that is the life

441,7,12-Nov,Andy, No You must answer topical political questions How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed And what other state has the equal number
442,7,12-Nov,Jada, I dont know
443,7,12-Nov,Andy, Do you know the other state
444,7,12-Nov,Darryl, Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star and we could ask for clues and hell tell us if were hot or cold
445,7,12-Nov,Andy, The star has been hidden Is the little girl hot or cold Well it turns out shes burning up because the star is right behind her ear

144,7,17,Holly, Uhm
145,7,17,Michael, Is it is it because youre afraid of where this is gonna take me See because I need you to keep me grounded
146,7,17,Holly, Not worried about that

157,7,17,Michael, I am a huge Woody Allen fan Although Ive only seen Antz but Ill tell you something What I respect about that man is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press about how Antz was just a ripoff of A Bugs Life he stayed true to his films Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz The thing is I thought Bugs Life was better much better Than Ants The point is dont listen to your critics listen to your fans

31,7,25/26,Jim, We are the Search Committee handpicked by our CEO and tasked to find this branchs new manager Not everyone we meet will be good but someones bound to be right  And to be honest I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here inhouse so Im not too worried But Im really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe  Did you know that Gabes last name was Lewis I had no idea
32,7,25/26,Stanley,  Good morning
33,7,25/26,Darryl, Good morning

38,7,25/26,Darryl, I have a solid relationship with Jo the companys owner I have management experience I have a good friendship with Jim the head of the Search Committee and it doesnt hurt that Im  blaaaack
39,7,25/26,Andy, 
40,7,25/26,Erin,  Its good I really hope you get it
41,7,25/26,Andy, The manager job Nah Im barely interested I just cant not go for it You know its not the Bernard way We give it the old college try and then in defeat we show grace
42,7,25/26,Erin, Still Id really like to see this office with you in the bosss chair
43,7,25/26,Andy, Dont even  EEEHHHH
44,7,25/26,Erin, You in the bosss chair
45,7,25/26,Andy, EEEHHH No Hehe
46,7,25/26,Andy, In my family you dont really go out and get things If you want something you write it on a list and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it on Wednesdays and Fridays So I dont know I guess you could say this job is on my list and  well see what Rosa comes back with
47,7,25/26,Erin,  Did you hear anything
48,7,25/26,Phyllis, Oh Im sure theyll let us know when they get the results 
49,7,25/26,Phyllis, It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child
50,7,25/26,Erin, So Phyllis might be my mom I mean the chances are tiny but
51,7,25/26,Phyllis, But probably not I mean it was a big year for babies Porkys had come out
52,7,25/26,Erin, Yeah Im sure I was just another Porkys baby
53,7,25/26,Phyllis, Mm
54,7,25/26,Erin, But why not find out
55,7,25/26,Phyllis, Yeah
56,7,25/26,Pam,  Should you really be so blatant about that
57,7,25/26,Dwight, They wont make me manager and I wont settle for anything less Ive gone about as far as I can here Thats obvious Time to take my talents elsewhere
58,7,25/26,Pam, Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks
59,7,25/26,Dwight, Bread is the paper of the food industry You write your sandwich on it
60,7,25/26,Warren Buffett, Can you do any better on salary
61,7,25/26,Jim, Unfortunately that range is set at corporate
62,7,25/26,Warren, What about mileage when I use my car I mean gas aint cheap you know
63,7,25/26,Jim, Heh We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous
64,7,25/26,Warren, How about 27 And uh when I make longdistance calls will they be monitored or is it on the honor system
65,7,25/26,Angela,  Okay  How odd a very unusual phone call from the Senators office The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens
66,7,25/26,Kevin, The Botanical Gardens Scrantons hidden gem Dont eat any berries you dont recognize
67,7,25/26,Toby, How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here
68,7,25/26,Robert California, You dont work in sales do you
69,7,25/26,Toby, Uh Human Resources
70,7,25/26,Robert, You see I sit across from a man I see his face I see his eyes Now does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deepsea drilling equipment Dont be a fool He wants respect He wants love He wants to be younger He wants to be attractive There is no such thing as a product Dont ever think there is There is only sx Everything is sx You understand that what Im telling you is a universal truth Toby
71,7,25/26,Toby, Yes
72,7,25/26,Gabe, Okay II am Im almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position  Do you um do you think that you are
73,7,25/26,Robert, Do I look like someone who would waste my own time
74,7,25/26,Gabe, No 
75,7,25/26,Jim, Can you  You are a man of great confidence Could you speak a little more to that and what the role of confidence would be in a dialogue with a subordinate
76,7,25/26,Robert, Will you be heard Will you have a voice Will I steamroll over you Do you feel heard right now Jim Do you have a voice right now You can answer me
77,7,25/26,Jim, Yes
78,7,25/26,Robert, That was your choice not mine The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller It is up to the object whether it will be flattened or not and I can tell from the small interaction weve had already you wont be flattened by anybody Do you agree with me Jim
79,7,25/26,Jim, Yes
80,7,25/26,Robert,  Yes You do 
81,7,25/26,Jim,  He creeps me out  But I think he might be a genius
82,7,25/26,Andy,  Good luck Darryl
83,7,25/26,Darryl,  Thank you
84,7,25/26,Darryl, Think about it What other mammal besides humans drinks the milk of another mammal I mean you dont see a bear drinking raccoon milk
85,7,25/26,Jim,  Oh
86,7,25/26,Darryl, So this is cool I think we make a good fit 
87,7,25/26,Gabe, Oh Uh we havent started the interview yet Were youwere you joking
88,7,25/26,Darryl, Uh  yes I was  Little joke
89,7,25/26,Toby, So how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office
90,7,25/26,Darryl, I thought that was your job
91,7,25/26,Toby, Well its one of my strengths but its the managers job
92,7,25/26,Jim, Well for instance how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight
93,7,25/26,Darryl, Ill answer that Jim I would use it as an opportunity to teach uh about actions and consequences of actions 
94,7,25/26,Darryl,  Whos that
95,7,25/26,Jim,  So I think all we need is a resume and well be good right
96,7,25/26,Darryl, I I just thought you knew me
97,7,25/26,Jim, Yeah its no big deal just something that looks like that  Cool 
98,7,25/26,Darryl, Let me  Oh Cool 
99,7,25/26,Merv Bronte,  Did uh you just interview
100,7,25/26,Robert, Ohh unfortunately yes
101,7,25/26,Merv, What do you mean
102,7,25/26,Robert, That business cant attract anyone Its awful up there Those people seem like theyre in prison waiting out life sentences in a dying industry
103,7,25/26,Merv, Place must be horrible I dont know if I want this job 
104,7,25/26,Merv,  Well if I get this job offer and then I know that Im gonna take it and if I take it I know that Im never gonna quit and then 25 years are gonna go by and Im gonna die here
105,7,25/26,Dwight, What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview  What are you doing  Stop trying to figure me out
106,7,25/26,Robert, I just did
107,7,25/26,Dwight, You cant
108,7,25/26,Robert, Its done
109,7,25/26,Dwight, No its not
110,7,25/26,Robert, You dont know me Anything about me Get out of my head

113,7,25/26,Dwight,  Get out
114,7,25/26,Dwight, Im gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak passionless leadership Do you see my hat No Thats because I just threw it in the ring
115,7,25/26,Merv, You guys pay for relocation though right

117,7,25/26,Merv, Well Id want to move further away you know Just I dont want any chance to run into my coworkers outside the office
118,7,25/26,Jim, Can I ask why youre leaving your current job
119,7,25/26,Merv,  Im leaving my other job because they were all jerks really  You know all of em You had your jerkwads and your jerkoffs so just between the wads and the offs I just I had to get outta there 
120,7,25/26,Jim, Is this a bad time to be doing this
121,7,25/26,Merv, Im having a bad time 
122,7,25/26,Toby, Im sorry if we did something to upset you Im sure it was inadvertent
123,7,25/26,Merv,  Wait

398,7,25/26,Jim, Hes not a real candidate
399,7,25/26,Kelly, I dont know Jim cause makes me think about something my grandfather used to say which is that sometimes the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat that is the hand that you want on the wheel
400,7,25/26,Jim, You took the deal
401,7,25/26,Kelly, Yeah it was a great deal
402,7,25/26,Jim, Thats not okay

404,7,25/26,Toby, Well we could try him out for a little while  and if it doesnt work out you know maybe one of us could you know step in
405,7,25/26,Jim, What is happening right now
406,7,25/26,Phyllis, Is it true that youre making Dwight the manager
407,7,25/26,Jim, No why would you think that
408,7,25/26,Phyllis, He and Kelly said then they prefired me
409,7,25/26,Jim, Okay  Okay guys just so you all know no decision has been made and Dwight is definitely not the boss
410,7,25/26,Kelly, That is correct Actually Dwight is not the manager yet
411,7,25/26,Jim, No no no Not ever cause thats not gonna happen
412,7,25/26,Dwight, Well its not entirely up to you is it Seems to me like someones getting a little powermad
413,7,25/26,Jim, Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge I feel like Im going a little bit crazy

415,7,25/26,Jim, Thank you
416,7,25/26,Andy, Who do you like for the job Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first but now seems like a safe if not slightly unexciting choice

436,7,25/26,Pam, A homeless person Really A homeless person
437,7,25/26,Ryan, No youre right Pam lets just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it
438,7,25/26,Pam, No I want you to say that you think the best person to be our new manager is a homeless person
439,7,25/26,Ryan, Let me guess who you want Pam Rachael Ray The ladies of The View

1,8,1,Oscar, Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend Basically you lie like a plank in weird places Thats it Sometimes you get run over Welcome to the Internet

3,8,1,Andy,  After you my good sir
4,8,1,Dwight, No I insist
5,8,1,Andy, I insist
6,8,1,Jim, The Search Committee finally decided after a lot of deliberation on Robert California for the manager position Who took one look around and left He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO CEO her own job He talked her out of her own job And I dont really know how someone does that But anyway then the position was his to fill And he chose
7,8,1,Andy,  I its unbelievable True I may have been the second choice but I was the firstchoices first choice And about Dwight I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk And I told him I need a really strong number two I want you to be my enforcer Smart right
8,8,1,Kelly,  Very smart
9,8,1,Andy, Uh this has got to stop
10,8,1,Kelly, I cant get down

19,8,1,Angela, Look its a Little Pregs  and Big Pregs 
20,8,1,Pam, Wait when did we start calling it that
21,8,1,Angela, Isnt it amazing the difference in our sizes

25,8,1,Darryl, Im lifting
26,8,1,Darryl, Yeah I wanted the manager job but I got somethin much better This soda This is mine
27,8,1,Stanley, It might be easier if you take a deep breath lift from the knees and shove it up your butt
28,8,1,Stanley, I came up with a new thing this summer I act like Im telling someone how to do somethin I go on with a long description and then I say and shove it up your butt Its stupid but its my thing now
29,8,1,Jim, No one should be planking at all
30,8,1,Andy, Thank you yes Dwight my enforcer my number two can you take care of this
31,8,1,Dwight, Say no more
32,8,1,Dwight,  Kids dont try planking Its dangerous  Specially with me around
33,8,1,Jim, You watching that commercial again  Why do you keep watching it if you know its just gonna make you cry
34,8,1,Pam, Because everything makes me cry so whats the difference This dog he just wants to protect his bone
35,8,1,Jim, Hes got a bank vault Thats a start
36,8,1,Pam, Not enough though
37,8,1,Jim, The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time But whenever he takes a break he does these weird walks around the office And you never know who hes gonna zero in on for these really intense smalltalks You just hope its not you And yet you hope it is you too Its strange

194,8,1,Robert, Let me tell you some things I find productive Positive reinforcement Negative reinforcement Honesty Ill tell you some things I find unproductive Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues And then inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night No I do not believe in that at all If I invited you to lunch I think youre a winner If I didnt I dont But I just met you all Life is long opinions change Winners prove me right Losers prove me wrong
195,8,1,Phyllis, Whew well I guess thats that

200,8,1,Robert, Im not gonna change my list Andy and I dont use ballpoint pens
201,8,1,Andy, Well then I will make a new list for you Stanley you may think hes a lazy grump but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office And you may think hes hard to love but did you know that hes in not one but two longterm romantic relationships
202,8,1,Robert, I did not know about the sales figures
203,8,1,Andy, Meredith Palmer Supplier relations The word no not even in her vocabulary And just to show you that Im being fair You had Gabe in the loser column I think that is astute Good call Pam easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with

173,8,2,Oscar, We dont get it
174,8,2,Andy, Well how does this work

180,8,2,Meredith, How does one get a point

182,8,2,Kelly, Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator Its so gross
183,8,2,Andy, Theres lots of stuff John Irving collected works Twentytwo points Or you can pool your points and redeem fiftyfive for this maternity shirt
184,8,2,Stanley, How bout you want us to work harder pay us more
185,8,2,Andy, I cant
186,8,2,Kelly, This point system is really insulting
187,8,2,Andy, Ooh I didnt mean to offend you and I hope youll forgive me because I am very very Sari  Sixteen points
188,8,2,Kelly, Thats a tablecloth
189,8,2,Jim, What if we went all the way up to five hundred points

156,8,3,Kevin,  OK Im not gonna make it Im turning back
157,8,3,Jim, Theres gotta be a better way to do this This is literally how they built the pyramids
158,8,3,Dwight, Well they whipped people which was helpful But youre right We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday
159,8,3,Jim, Yeah  Not that theyre not smart people
160,8,3,Dwight,  No no Very smart Uh theirs is more of a physical intelligence
161,8,3,Jim, Id go with that
162,8,3,Dwight, Like baboons or elephants
163,8,3,Jim, Not that dont
164,8,3,Kevin, Guys When I was a kid my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen Then really made them laugh
165,8,3,Jim, Its a great idea Kev I dont think it applies here though so maybe we just
166,8,3,Kevin, Yeah we move stuff and it was fun
167,8,3,Dwight, Kevin Doesnt apply
168,8,3,Kevin, Right My mom
169,8,3,Erin,  You need to drop it OK They hate it I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it 
170,8,3,Andy, Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap  Youll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously Um
171,8,3,Male Applicant 1, How much longer is this gonna take
172,8,3,Darryl, Did you hire em
173,8,3,Andy, No Because they all left
174,8,3,Darryl, What do you mean they left
175,8,3,Andy, I mean after you bailed I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didnt help
176,8,3,Darryl, Then I think you should fire me
177,8,3,Andy, What are you talking about Im not gonna fire you
178,8,3,Darryl, Yeah Just put me out of my misery
179,8,3,Andy, OK this is weird I dont I dont get the joke
180,8,3,Darryl, No OK I dont wanna be here anymore Fire me
181,8,3,Andy, So Darryl says to me fire me But what he really means is Im gonna say something really weird try and figure out what it means So I say No youre not fired But what I really mean is I have no idea what your talking about but Im gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling betterI really hope thats what he and I mean
182,8,3,Andy, Attention Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse We can pay Come on Oscar whos the most jacked guy in all of Scranton Like your wildest fantasy guy
183,8,3,Oscar, Bulk or definition

187,8,3,Oscar, Oh hes plenty strong
188,8,3,Oscar, It used to be Reggie Winters out at Golds Gym But he moved away And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean Um but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh and his triceps went to hell
189,8,3,Pam, So Ive been thinking after we win the lottery we take our winnings
190,8,3,Jim, Our fake winnings
191,8,3,Pam, And we move to the south of France See No theres plenty of bicycling for you I think thats where they do the Tour de France
192,8,3,Jim, It is yeah I mean I just dont know why Im compromising if its my fantasy Cause in my fantasy its Maine and you love it
193,8,3,Pam, Because Im never gonna act like that even in your fantasy
194,8,3,Jim, Nope Youre youre doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now 
195,8,3,Dwight, Hey idiot What did Erin want again

199,8,3,Andy, GreatWell itll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse
200,8,3,Gideon, FYI Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule
201,8,3,Andy, Eh cool Well figure that out
202,8,3,Nate, Also FYI ah I dont techinically have a hearing problem but sometimes when theres a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time Ill hear em as one big jumble Uh again its not that I cant hear uh because thats false I can Um I just cant distinguish between everything Im hearing
203,8,3,Andy, Got it Dually noted You  Coolest tnk top I have ever seen Where did you get that
204,8,3,Bruce, Made it

208,8,3,Dwight, Kevin Costner
209,8,3,Jim, Yeah 
210,8,3,Kevin, So I found this grease And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea
211,8,3,Erin, You did say it was a great idea I heard you say it
212,8,3,Jim, So its not the dumbest idea
213,8,3,Dwight, Its not the greatest one either
214,8,3,Jim, But the fact remains we gotta move these boxes
215,8,3,Dwight, And its clear were not going to carry them 
216,8,3,Jim, So sadly its the best idea on the table
217,8,3,Dwight, Exactly
218,8,3,Kevin, I think were ready to give thi  Jim
219,8,3,Jim, Is he OK
220,8,3,Dwight, Yep Hell be fine

230,8,3,Nate, Also Darryl FYI I already told this to Andy but uh you should probably know I technically dont have a hearing problem its just when theres a lot of noises
231,8,3,Andy, Nate Pleasethank you You have no business education you were gonna take classes under DAngelo what happened to that
232,8,3,Darryl, He died

254,8,3,Dwight, OK I can see why youre angry youre coming into this cold But believe me a lot of thought went into this
255,8,3,Darryl, And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease
256,8,3,Kevin, OK Darryl listen and then you will understand The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now its cool cause we found another use for them

208,8,4,Darryl, Rosebud
209,8,4,Oscar, Its a reference to Citizen Kane Something that explains why a person became the way they are
210,8,4,Darryl, I know Citizen Kane Rosebud didnt explain why he was how he was it just represented what was important to him as a child that he missed
211,8,4,Oscar, Different school of thought Lets just agree to disagree
212,8,4,Darryl, No Youre wrong

159,8,5,Bert, Try a box jelly fish
160,8,5,Jim, You know thats
161,8,5,Robert, What are we talking about
162,8,5,Jim, I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too
163,8,5,Robert,  You seem unimpressed Ghosts dont scare you
164,8,5,Kevin, Im only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers Not things that dont exist like ghosts or mummies
165,8,5,Oscar, Mummies are real There are mummies at museums
166,8,5,Kevin, Yeah prank
167,8,5,Robert, Its true Theyve been preserved for thousands of years Theyre all over
168,8,5,Kevin,  Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it
169,8,5,Erin, Witchs brew
170,8,5,Erin, I grew this party up real fast Get out of here little kid party Nobody loves you And clean up your room Grownups are going to use it later Oooh
171,8,5,Jim, Party looks fun doesnt it Everybody seems to be in there having a great time So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer
172,8,5,Bert, Im using it Im about to play Starcraft with him 
173,8,5,Jim,  Are you serious
174,8,5,Dwight, Yeah Im serious
175,8,5,Jim, Thats funny Ok
176,8,5,Dwight, Loser

187,8,5,Erin,  Oookayyy everybody Be prepared to be scared Ok 
188,8,5,Gabe, The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea
189,8,5,Oscar,  Is that my grandmother
190,8,5,Andy, Whats the story
191,8,5,Oscar, There is no story
192,8,5,Gabe, Yeah it seems like there isnt a narrative  Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting
193,8,5,Stanley, What the hell is going on here
194,8,5,Andy, I think weve seen enough You can turn it off now  Yeah turn it off now
195,8,5,Stanley, How did you get in my car

197,8,5,Andy, That was awful Robert I apologize
198,8,5,Erin, Im sorry I got confused I heard you wanted to make the party more adult But I think I know what to do now  This game is called pecker Poker  Its the game of cards that gets you hard
199,8,5,Andy, What we have here is a classic misunderstanding
200,8,5,Robert, Why didnt you simply ask Andy to clarify Asking is a very easy thing to do Youre obviously very close  Oh I see This no longer seems like my business 
201,8,5,Erin, All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so
202,8,5,Robert, You were going to talk at the end of the Im not here
203,8,5,Andy, Did you think I was going to fire you No I wasnt  Im sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you
204,8,5,Robert, Im never uncomfortable
205,8,5,Andy, Ok Erin I think you know Ive been dating someone
206,8,5,Erin, Sure
207,8,5,Andy, And its getting a little more serious Shes never come by
208,8,5,Erin, And shes never called here Unless its your mom
209,8,5,Andy, No I didnt want her to call because I thought it would be weird But now its weird that shes not calling
210,8,5,Erin, Two dates Three dates
211,8,5,Andy, Thirtyone
212,8,5,Erin, Wow Im so happy for you guys Um let me know when you get to forty Ill see you guys

214,8,5,Darryl, I just dont get it Pam I mean youre a rational person
215,8,5,Jim,  Thank you
216,8,5,Pam, Jim doesnt let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs How is this any less logical
217,8,5,Jim, Careful whoa First of all its not like I think thats going to help the Eagles win
218,8,5,Pam, Really
219,8,5,Jim, No That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better Its not
220,8,5,Kevin, Exactly
221,8,5,Jim, Thank you
222,8,5,Dwight, Go get up there right now
223,8,5,Bert, Got it
224,8,5,Darryl, Dwight
225,8,5,Dwight, You wanna attack or let them come to us Your call B
226,8,5,Bert, Unleash the hellstorm
227,8,5,Darryl, Dwight
228,8,5,Dwight,  Nice
229,8,5,Darryl, Dwight
230,8,5,Dwight, Got em Go
231,8,5,Phyllis, Is she Asian
232,8,5,Erin, I dont know Shes from somewhere I bet Maybe from the forest
233,8,5,Phyllis, Forest Did Andy say his girlfriends from the forest
234,8,5,Erin, I dont know Phyllis Maybe shes from the city
235,8,5,Phyllis, Hmm
236,8,5,Robert, Looks terribly real doesnt it Creed
237,8,5,Creed, No
238,8,5,Robert, Are you scared of snakes
239,8,5,Creed, You dont live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes Bobby
240,8,5,Darryl, in the bathroom with Robert Yeah I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive
241,8,5,Meredith,  Honestly Jim gives me the creeps
242,8,5,Robert,  What am I up to
243,8,5,Jim, Like a few years down the road Cece says Mom theres a ghost in my closet Now you say one of two things  one Youre just having a bad dream or two Lets go see what it was
244,8,5,Pam, Im not gonna freak her out Jim
245,8,5,Jim, Ok
246,8,5,Pam, Im not gonna lie to her either
247,8,5,Jim, Oh come on
248,8,5,Robert, When I was a boy there was an empty house just up the hill from my familys It was rumored a man committed su1c1de there after being possessed by the devil One day a young woman Lydia moved into the house with her infant child That very night Lydia was awakened by a loud heinous hissing sound  She walked to the nursery and there in babys crib was a snake wrapped around babys neck squeezing tighter and tighter
249,8,5,Creed, Oh my goodness
250,8,5,Robert, The crib was full of dirt Baby struggled to free itself from underneath reaching and clawing gasping for air Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi lurching toward baby for they were mummies
251,8,5,Kevin, Nooo
252,8,5,Robert, Amongst them was a man tall slim
253,8,5,Meredith, Jim 
254,8,5,Robert, Almost instinctively she turned to her husband Oh wait she thought I dont have a husband For Lydia and her husband had had an argument one they couldnt get past Each night they slept one inch farther apart until one night Lydia left It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds She had quit the book club the choir citing something about their high expectations Her lips slowly grew together from disuse Everytime she wanted to act and didnt another part of her face hardened until it was stone And that fevered night she rushed to the nursery threw open the door Baby are you okay Baby sat up slowly turned to mother and said Im fine btch Im fine
255,8,5,Bert, 
256,8,5,Robert, Fear plays an interesting role in our lives How dare we let it motivate us How dare we let it into our decision making into our livelihoods into our relationships Its funny isnt it we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear
257,8,5,Bert, Toby
258,8,5,Toby, Oh hey Bert Wanna see the dance Dem bones dem bones dem dry
259,8,5,Bert, Youre fired

17,8,6,Robert,  This is atrocious
18,8,6,Andy, You go first
19,8,6,Robert, The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy careless error prone office
20,8,6,Andy, Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword Sometimes
21,8,6,Dwight,  Sorry go ahead
22,8,6,Robert,  Did you need something from us
23,8,6,Dwight, WhaYes Your attention Uh because No that is all 
24,8,6,Dwight, Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world The vice president had all the power Athletes fought for silver medals Women were considered the best gender And stadiums of fans shouted Were number two As with all my dreams Im guessing it was about my fear of immigrants
25,8,6,Robert, Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free
26,8,6,Andy, Umpfthats not good Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there
27,8,6,Robert, Who are they
28,8,6,Andy, Theyre both Kevin Oscar is the sx and the City gang and Angela if you can picture
29,8,6,Robert, Andrew sometimes I feel like you dont know me at all
30,8,6,Andy, I would agree with that
31,8,6,Robert, Simplyend the mistakes
32,8,6,Andy, End the mistakes easy
33,8,6,Robert, When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes we can talk about names all day Our favorite names silly made up names normal names said in a silly voice Wouldnt that be nice
34,8,6,Andy, I would like that
35,8,6,Robert, End the mistakes That is all I ask  And you cant have a favorite Iron Chef It depends entirely on the secret ingredient Sometimes I feel you dont know food at all
36,8,6,Jim, Im just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derbys in a really good place now Somy pitch isme Pam you and someone else maybe Justine
37,8,6,Darryl, Nahh  No Not Justine Never Justine

44,8,6,Darryl, Ill be there
45,8,6,Gabe, Hey
46,8,6,Val, Hey
47,8,6,Gabe, Mondays suck
48,8,6,Val, Yeahayup  Just trying to get in
49,8,6,Dwight, I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem This is a project Ive been working on for quite some time and today might be the day to use it
50,8,6,Andy, What do you got
51,8,6,Dwight,  Allow me Youre going to love this  Ughshouldve used a shorter string Never mind I know it by heart It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone elses work
52,8,6,Andy, Sounds controversial
53,8,6,Dwight, Have I not been worthy of your trust Have I not been a reliable number two
54,8,6,Andy, Do not go there Youre the deuce I never want to drop
55,8,6,Dwight, Well I can make this work Ill set it up right now Just need your go ahead
56,8,6,Andy, Go do the voodoo that you do so well

59,8,6,Gabe, Hey I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship
60,8,6,Toby, For you
61,8,6,Gabe, Yes For Gabe
62,8,6,Toby, Who are you seeing Thats gr
63,8,6,Gabe, Whom Im seeing is Val from down in the warehouse
64,8,6,Toby, Oh
65,8,6,Gabe, Im not technically seeing her but uh Ive seen her with the eyes and uh there was attraction In at least one direction So
66,8,6,Toby, You know I dont have to do the paperwork unless youre actually dating
67,8,6,Gabe, Ok but once this starts its going to be moving fast Its going to be hot and heavy and I dont want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock You know
68,8,6,Toby, But I meanuh have you talked to her Is sh
69,8,6,Gabe, Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays
70,8,6,Toby, Do you know her last name yet
71,8,6,Gabe, Toby Im going to tell you her last name tomorrow because shes going to be screaming it tonight
72,8,6,Toby, Shes going to be screaming her own last name
73,8,6,Gabe, Hey Watch it
74,8,6,Toby, Good luck Gabe
75,8,6,Andy, Hi guys I just wanted to say that you all have been doing amazing work really
76,8,6,Kevin, Thank you
77,8,6,Andy, And Id like to add that your work has been a little sloppy So Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to callDwight
78,8,6,Dwight, The accountability booster It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office From a late delivery to an accounting error Five strikes in a day equals a home run One home run and youre out
79,8,6,Andy, If we as a group make five mistakes in a day something bad happens like we block Minesweeper
80,8,6,Dwight, Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown And as a failsafe also every negative email youve ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him
81,8,6,Kelly, What emails are you talking about
82,8,6,Dwight, Creep by TLC Creep by Radio Head You remember that one Jim There is no way he hasnt strangled at least one stripper Oscar He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him Kelly
83,8,6,Kelly, Thats not that bad actually
84,8,6,Dwight, PS We should should kll him
85,8,6,Jim, Wait so you installed a doomsday device
86,8,6,Dwight, No its an accountability booster
87,8,6,Jim, Which when it goes off it destroys everything Very similar to a doomsday device
88,8,6,Dwight, Jim youre trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other I am confident that you guys are equal to the task
89,8,6,Kelly, Um no were not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives
90,8,6,Ryan, We cant do this Dwight
91,8,6,Dwight, Smilenod Smile and nod
92,8,6,Dwight, They are making me out to be a Bond villian I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world Likenot Doctor Moreau someone good Doctor Frankenstein Doctor Jekyll not them Doctor
93,8,6,Andy, Are you sure this is a good idea I mean the thing about this office is we make a lot of mistakes
94,8,6,Dwight, But the device will change that Without a safety net people will improve
95,8,6,Andy, Alright everybody looks like we need to be getting to work Be extra careful Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha
96,8,6,Stanley, This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me
97,8,6,Oscar, Theres an easy way to tell if this device is a sham We just make a mistake Ill send an order down to shipping before weve received payment
98,8,6,Dwight,  Oh theres one mistake
99,8,6,Erin, Now we only have four strikes left until a home run
100,8,6,Andy, Dwights our coworker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I
101,8,6,Dwight, Its not a doomsday device gosh  We can do this you guys
102,8,6,Warehouse Crew, First Second
103,8,6,Darryl, Its not a race
104,8,6,Warehouse Crew, Thirrrrthird
105,8,6,Darryl, Who knows what the belt is for

110,8,6,Gabe, Look at this this is enormous
111,8,6,Gabe, I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown Considering thats the only thing I know about her I will be milking that hard 
112,8,6,Gabe, Its like a hula hoop Right Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way
113,8,6,Darryl, You done
114,8,6,Gabe, The Michelin man called he wants his cummerbund back
115,8,6,Phyllis, Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five

117,8,6,Angela, Kevin maybe I should handle that We really need you to focus on your project
118,8,6,Kevin, Good thinking
119,8,6,Kevin, Apparently a big client for this company needs to know the story of how paper gets made
120,8,6,Angela, Oscar use a calculator 
121,8,6,Oscar, When the stakes are this high there is only one computer that I trust And its powered by thai food and spanish reds 
122,8,6,Andy, Alright everybody you are doing great
123,8,6,Dwight, Well I wouldnt say that Three mistakes already is pretty terrible but I do see improvement Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look shes hard at work 
124,8,6,Jim, Dwight question
125,8,6,Dwight, No questions
126,8,6,Jim, If this doomsday device goes off
127,8,6,Dwight, Accountability booster
128,8,6,Jim, If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs Are you going to feel good about that
129,8,6,Dwight, I havent even considered it Thats how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work
130,8,6,Stanley, Try mose1234
131,8,6,Ryan, Dwight would never be that obvious Try something likez648  Not that exactly Jim something like that
132,8,6,Jim, Ok

86,8,7,Oscar, In this case yes
87,8,7,Dwight, No There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman
88,8,7,Phyllis, No were not

99,8,7,Andy, Thank you
100,8,7,Kevin, Were called Kevin and the Zits

103,8,7,Andy, Miss no more What do you play Join us
104,8,7,Kevin, I have a tambourine
105,8,7,Robert, Tambourine You know Im the CEO right
106,8,7,Andy,  CEOs dont play tambourines Tambourines are for girlfriends
107,8,7,Robert, I play harmonica I think I have one in the car
108,8,7,Andy, Great
109,8,7,Kevin, Nice guys Robert is going to be a Zit
110,8,7,Darryl, Again never agreed upon
111,8,7,Andy, I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band And when youre in a rock and roll band with somebody youre bonded for life
112,8,7,Darryl, Usually that life is short and tragic Thats okay right
113,8,7,Andy, Yeah even cooler
114,8,7,Kevin, We all got to go sometime
115,8,7,Pam, Hey
116,8,7,Jim, Hey
117,8,7,Pam, Helen Mirren Hot
118,8,7,Jim, Yeah Super pretty
119,8,7,Pam, Huh What about Cathy
120,8,7,Jim, The temp
121,8,7,Pam, Yeah Do you think shes hot
122,8,7,Jim, Nope
123,8,7,Pam, Im not asking if youre in to her Just objectively do you find her attractive
124,8,7,Jim, And Im telling you I dont
125,8,7,Pam, You dont find Cathy attractive
126,8,7,Jim, No I dont
127,8,7,Jim, No Im not going to tell my ninemonthspregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive Just like Im not going to tell my twoyearold daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun Its true but it doesnt help anybody
128,8,7,Pam, Look at her Even I want some fries with that shake
129,8,7,Jim, Okay Uh I dont So are we good 
130,8,7,Dwight, Thats just absurd
131,8,7,Pam, Yes because shes hot right
132,8,7,Dwight, Her breasts are large her waist is small her reproductive health in ample evidence And facial symmetry come on
133,8,7,Pam, The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently Like youre a kid almost They lose all sense of boundaries They start acting weird telling you things that clearly arent true I know it sounds nuts but I think Dwight is the only one whos telling me the truth
134,8,7,Pam, Dwight am I hot right now
135,8,7,Dwight, Why would I or anyone else think that youre hot right now I cant impregnate you and thats the driving force between malefemale attraction
136,8,7,Pam, What about before Was I attractive before
137,8,7,Dwight, Meh you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight gradual decline and a steep dropoff when you got pregnant for the first time Gradual recovery and uh well now obviously youre at an alltime low
138,8,7,Pam, Hmm I think Jims lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy
139,8,7,Dwight, You think Jims lying  Thats so cute I know hes lying
140,8,7,Pam, Five bucks if you can get him to admit it
141,8,7,Dwight, Done  I never touch a pregnant woman
142,8,7,Pam, Yep thats the Dwight I need
143,8,7,Dwight, If were going to work together we need some ground rules
144,8,7,Pam, Okay
145,8,7,Dwight, our only loyalty is to the truth
146,8,7,Pam, I think so Okay
147,8,7,Dwight, we stop at nothing
148,8,7,Pam, Well what does that is that okay
149,8,7,Dwight, Dont fall in love
150,8,7,Pam, Yep good
151,8,7,Dwight, Were gonna bust this guy
152,8,7,Pam, Honesty is very important to me
153,8,7,Dwight, So important And then we will destroy the man himself
154,8,7,Pam, Lets just see how we feel when we get there
155,8,7,Kelly, Well you came to the right person You have to follow your intuition Pam You dont want to end up like Elin Nordegren Actually what am I saying you wish you had her life no offense Pam
156,8,7,Dwight, None taken What do you got
157,8,7,Kelly, It is called the matchmaker test and it is very powerful Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy If Jim picks a really hot friend then we know that he thinks that Cathys hot
158,8,7,Pam, Hmm
159,8,7,Robert,  Hey you found us

176,8,7,Curtis,  Have you heard about the midnight rambler  Hey come on in baby Yeah
177,8,7,Pam, Hey I was talking to Cathy Turns out she is single
178,8,7,Jim, Oh I stand corrected
179,8,7,Pam, I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone Any ideas
180,8,7,Jim, Oh you know who might be good Mike Tibbets
181,8,7,Pam, Mike Tibbets really
182,8,7,Jim, Mmhmm
183,8,7,Ryan, Hey whos this Mike Tibbets guy What kind of car does he drive
184,8,7,Jim, Not his moms car

186,8,7,Jim, Touche
187,8,7,Kelly,  Eww
188,8,7,Pam, Kelly calm down
189,8,7,Kelly, I mean I guess hed be okay with hair Okay you should see if hell get hair plugs
190,8,7,Pam, I dont think Jim cares about his hair
191,8,7,Kelly, Yeah but I do Pam okay Its called being a nice person
192,8,7,Dwight, I dont see whats so ugly about him Hes got the broad face of a brewer
193,8,7,Pam, Jims on to me
194,8,7,Dwight, Hmm
195,8,7,Pam, Yeah Jim barely talks to Mike We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it
196,8,7,Dwight, Just ugly enough to have deniability
197,8,7,Pam, Yep
198,8,7,Jim, Mike Tibbets is like the most boringlooking guy I know So if that was for the matchmaker test I think Im in the clear If that wasnt for the matchmaker test then Cathy hes a really nice guy
199,8,7,Dwight, Well Jim may be lying with his words but he cant lie with his body
200,8,7,Kelly, Im gonna write something mean on his wall
201,8,7,Pam, No Kelly dont
202,8,7,Dwight, The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs The puffing of the chest mirroring increased blood flow to the crotch I say we start there

212,8,7,Dwight, I cant tell Its unnaturally sunken  Busted He just was mirroring Did you see that
213,8,7,Pam, No Maybe he just said something funny
214,8,7,Dwight, Jim has no discernible sense of humor Pam You should know that
215,8,7,Pam, I think hes just making her laugh
216,8,7,Dwight, Time for me to find out

267,8,7,Pam, Wait thats it Thats the question youre going to ask him
268,8,7,Dwight, We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is
269,8,7,Old Man, You have to share the machine with others
270,8,7,Dwight,  Well thats what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten
271,8,7,Jim, Okay Dwight come on  You can go first

279,8,7,Andy, We had to leave because of creative differences
280,8,7,Darryl, Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didnt really fit in with our thing
281,8,7,Kevin, Guys this means theyre Kevin and the Zits now

295,8,7,Jim, Pam are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test

37,8,8,Andy, Why even read business books We should be studying wr Going to places like Gettysburg Where is that
38,8,8,Erin, Its right here in PA
39,8,8,Andy,  Well we should take a fieldtrip there I mean that would be so cool I wonder if that bus downstairs is
40,8,8,Angela, Okay Andy we get it Its a trip to Gettysburg
41,8,8,Andy, That sounds super inspiring Im in
42,8,8,Dwight, Gettysburg Hmm Could be interesting Secondmost northern battle in the Civil wr
43,8,8,Oscar, Actually it is the northernmost
44,8,8,Dwight, Ha
45,8,8,Dwight, The Civil wr history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms  Whatever Im over it Its just grossly irresponsible
46,8,8,Andy, Charge
47,8,8,Phyllis, Well this could be fun I
48,8,8,Andy, Yeah well the bus has free wifi and I made special lowsugar lunches for everyone And is anyone kosher or halal
49,8,8,Ryan, Whats the halal option
50,8,8,Andy, Dates tabbouleh and a bagel with cream cheese
51,8,8,Ryan, Out
52,8,8,Andy, You know its the same as the kosher option Theres a lesson in there I mean I cant force you to go Youre not my slaves Thanks to Gettysburg But whos coming with me
53,8,8,Erin, Im in
54,8,8,Phyllis, Im in too
55,8,8,Dwight, Guess Im a sucker for historical fiction

62,8,8,Andy, And oh You missed your head  There you go Phyllis think fast
63,8,8,Andy, All right guys a little foreplay before we do it Fans of Ken Burns Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil wr
64,8,8,Darryl, You know I just got Limitless on my iPad I bet I could get it on the TV
65,8,8,Phyllis, Ooh Isnt that the one where the guy becomes limitless
66,8,8,Andy, Its just not appropri I mean if we were going to visit Bradley Coopers birthplace Id be the first one suggesting it Id be rooting for it
67,8,8,Everyone, Limitless Limitless Limitless Limitless
68,8,8,Andy, All right all right all right
69,8,8,Kevin, Not food and stuff

72,8,8,Pam, I cant get a fire pit I have two babies

74,8,8,Robert, Oh hi there
75,8,8,Pam, Plants and hi Robert Hey um how are you doing Good to see you again
76,8,8,Robert, Where is everyone Where is Andy
77,8,8,Kelly, Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg
78,8,8,Robert, Well I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy But what we have here is perhaps better By not going on the trip youve shown youre the freethinkers of the office
79,8,8,Ryan, Robert you got your sheep and you got your black sheep and Im not even a sheep Im on the freaking moon
80,8,8,Robert, So here what we can do Game changers changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again Everyone brainstorm some innovations Dont be afraid to get weird with it Meredith  Excited

91,8,8,Andy, Woo
92,8,8,Andy, Whoa where you going
93,8,8,Jim, Visitor center Gonna grab a map for the memorials right
94,8,8,Andy, Yeah were not going to the visitor center Were not tourists
95,8,8,Jim, No of course were not tourists Were just people that arent from here who are taking a tour
96,8,8,Phyllis, Yeah sign says Begin tour here
97,8,8,Andy, Unless youre going on the very speciallycreated and meticulouslyresearched Andy Bernard tour
98,8,8,Andy, After Chancellorsville Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley right through here They stopped in this field for a picnic which they called lunch
99,8,8,Erin,  Yeah but Im confused
100,8,8,Dwight, Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when youre talking about DPA thats deaths per acre
101,8,8,Erin, Mmhmm
102,8,8,Dwight, nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms
103,8,8,Erin, Oh DPA sounds way more important that total deaths
104,8,8,Dwight, Oh it is And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home I mean it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush  Im telling you theyre heartbreaking too So beautifully written
105,8,8,Oscar, Dwight what are you telling this girl
106,8,8,Dwight, The truth
107,8,8,Oscar, Stop filling her head with nonsense okay She doesnt know any better
108,8,8,Erin, Oscar I am so glad you just got here I wouldve believed everything he said
109,8,8,Dwight, No no no Youre filling her head with nonsense You and the history books Im telling the truth
110,8,8,Erin, Interesting
111,8,8,Dwight, Yes thank you All of history has been whitewashed
112,8,8,Oscar, Really Why dont you tell us the real history Gore Vidal
113,8,8,Dwight, Okay I will I dont know who that is but Im gonna tell you this
114,8,8,Oscar, hes a historian
115,8,8,Dwight, Gettysburg was very important Credit where credit is due okay Big mad props to Gettysburg Was it however the most northern battle of the civil wr
116,8,8,Oscar, Yes yes yes
117,8,8,Dwight, Not by a long shot
118,8,8,Erin, No
119,8,8,Oscar, Yes
120,8,8,Dwight, No it was not
121,8,8,Oscar, Argh
122,8,8,Dwight, No it was not Was it the secondmost northern
123,8,8,Oscar, What
124,8,8,Dwight, Sure I will cede it was the secondmost northernmost battle
125,8,8,Oscar, Erin
126,8,8,Dwight, Was it the northernmost No Get out of here Oscar
127,8,8,Erin, Get out of here
128,8,8,Robert, I am so eager to hear your gamechangers Lets dig in shall we
129,8,8,Ryan, May I go first
130,8,8,Robert, Absolutely
131,8,8,Ryan, Raw fish the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat Now we cant get enough of it From movie stars to construction workers sushi is whats for dinner Let me throw another idea at you Origami What The crazy art of paper folding from thats right Japan Dont you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan We can do that With origami Its the sushi of paper
132,8,8,Robert, This idea hasnt gripped me What else did you come up with
133,8,8,Ryan, Well I had to memorize the presentation Robert and it took a long time to build the swan so
134,8,8,Robert, That was bad
135,8,8,Stanley, If your woman is like mine I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time This paper is so hard It scratches Why cant there be a paper just for me Well now there is Papyr Paper for women Its pink scented and silky soft Now you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister
136,8,8,Robert, The situation you described returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine is not one Im familiar with
137,8,8,Stanley, In the AfricanAmerican community
138,8,8,Robert, No
139,8,8,Stanley,  Thought it was worth a try
140,8,8,Darryl, Thats fascinating Tell me whats the significance of the peach orchard thought
141,8,8,Park Ranger, Oh well thats a great question Actually some of the most
142,8,8,Dwight, Excuse me I got a question for you
143,8,8,Park Ranger, Sure
144,8,8,Dwight, Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms
145,8,8,Park Ranger, Uh I havent heard of that one
146,8,8,Dwight, Really Okay followup question How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut
147,8,8,Oscar, I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding
148,8,8,Andy, We dont need to bother this poor gentleman I know exactly where were going Giddy up Tallyho
149,8,8,Chelsea,  Are you Lincoln
150,8,8,Gabe, No no Im
151,8,8,Gabe, Apparently I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums historical monuments elementary schools I dont see it
152,8,8,Chelsea's Mom, Chelsea give Mr Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture
153,8,8,Gabe, Okay Quick
154,8,8,Man, Hey Lincolns starting 
155,8,8,Gabe, Oh uh no No no no no Im uh Im actually with a tour group myself so  Hello Im Abraham Lincoln Some people call me the great emancipator but uh you might know me from the penny 
156,8,8,Pam, Okay You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us and as you know as I tell it I dont like it Unless of course you are responding to it
157,8,8,Robert, I am not
158,8,8,Pam, Um excuse me Im gonna go to the bathroom
159,8,8,Pam, At this point when youre this pregnant its kind of like senior spring The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet
160,8,8,Robert, Kevin youve been quiet Im curious to know what your gamechanger is
161,8,8,Kevin, Well you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A1 spot They do that cause they think A1s the best spot for the best cookie But the real best spot is D4 Right Thats where the eyes go So
162,8,8,Robert, Cookies Cookie placement
163,8,8,Kevin, Yeah But not just the cookies though That was just a for instance
164,8,8,Robert, Who else agrees with Kevin that were wasting facilities manpower on our underselling products when we should be pushing our topperformers  There you go Consensus
165,8,8,Ryan, Okay we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around and I am just some goodlooking guy
166,8,8,Gabe,  I just dont understand Its 1865 victory is ours Ive saved the very soul of our nation and yet happiness eludes me Oh perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits
167,8,8,Audience, No
168,8,8,Kevin, Kay so another thing about oatmeal cookies Who even wants them I mean Ive seen Toby eat one like once but other than that  like forget it
169,8,8,Robert, Interesting So what is Dunder Mifflins oatmeal cookie What is the product that no one wants
170,8,8,Stanley, how about that twoholepunch letter Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal
171,8,8,Robert, Thats the oatmeal cookie Fantastic Kevin Fantastic 
172,8,8,Kevin, Thank you
173,8,8,Jim, By the way did we leave all the food on the bus
174,8,8,Andy, Lets talk about food for a second Food for thought
175,8,8,Jim, Yeah thats what I had for breakfast and I think thats probably why Im still hungry
176,8,8,Andy, Hunger Hunger for victory Hunger for honor Hunger for pride
177,8,8,Darryl, Hunger for hamburger
178,8,8,Erin, Hunger for chicken chimichangas Right Darryl
179,8,8,Darryl, Thats good
180,8,8,Andy, Exactly Now do you know the Civil wr soldiers were hungry for Pride Now each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away chased it down with nothing but a sword Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died He wasnt about to let them have that flag Pride Right guys  I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin Cost me two hundred dollars
181,8,8,Jim, Only two hundred dollars
182,8,8,Andy, We are all branches on this tree And from the tree comes paper Were all part of a business But business is wr Whats that I hear Uh a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag Wha whats going on here Weehoo Come and get it Whos gonna get the flag Whos getting it Whoa Hey Ho Dont look where I am look where Im going Juke right juke left
183,8,8,Darryl, Andy this is inappropriate People died here man
184,8,8,Andy, Get the flag Get the flag Come on Big Tuna What you gonna do about it We got a flag right here Weehoo
185,8,8,Andy, Spangler Springs is a mile this way
186,8,8,Jim, Oh wow So thats two miles if you incorporate the walk back
187,8,8,Andy, Its I mean come on
188,8,8,Phyllis, I dont think I should walk anymore You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal yogurt coffee orange juice and toast Two poached eggs And then half a sandwich on the bus
189,8,8,Andy, Alright fine You know what  I guess this place just hasnt rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would Im still going And Im not going to ask anymore Im not even going to look back Im just going to assume that youre with me
190,8,8,Dwight,  You said you werent going to look back
191,8,8,Robert, And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared
192,8,8,Kevin, I dont know
193,8,8,Robert, Right I mean youre an accountant Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane
194,8,8,Kevin, Yes I am an accountant
195,8,8,Oscar, Dwight  this is one of the archivists here I thought maybe we could consult him
196,8,8,Dwight, Really
197,8,8,Oscar, Yeah
198,8,8,Dwight, Well Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms
199,8,8,Archivist, Schrute Farms did you say That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil wr
200,8,8,Oscar, Youve heard about it
201,8,8,Dwight, YES Ha Prepare to be refuted Go on
202,8,8,Archivist, There you go
203,8,8,Narrator, Families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front
204,8,8,Soldier, Dearest mother Im sorry it has been so long since my last letter It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive Melvin Fifer Garris
205,8,8,Dwight, Hallowed ground
206,8,8,Narrator, But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the wr
207,8,8,Amanda, You have to understand Poets artists dancers  these kind of men preferred peace to wr These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms Amidst the macho brutality of wr this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive and well fabulous
208,8,8,Oscar, Wow This is so much better than the story you made up
209,8,8,Dwight, Ive seen enough
210,8,8,Oscar, Youre right There should be a monument to this
211,8,8,Kevin, Never trust a cookie with a womans name Pecan Sandy Lorna Doone Madeline Theyll just break your heart
212,8,8,Robert,  Kevin
213,8,8,Ryan, Robert I hate to interrupt But I would love to pitch you one last idea I call it the Big Mac idea
214,8,8,Kevin, What No
215,8,8,Robert, Big Mac idea That sounds encouraging
216,8,8,Ryan, Its really really good Robert Let me explain
217,8,8,Kevin, No This is not fair This is my idea Hes trying to steal it because hes jealous of me
218,8,8,Robert, Well what is the idea
219,8,8,Kevin, Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands
220,8,8,Ryan, You know what Now I remember That was your idea  That is 100 percent your idea
221,8,8,Robert, Oh my It was just actually cookies the whole time
222,8,8,Andy,  Dammit
223,8,8,Darryl, Hey
224,8,8,Andy, You guys came Wheres everyone else
225,8,8,Darryl, Back at the bus We were locked out Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich
226,8,8,Andy, Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there I guess he follows orders
227,8,8,Jim, Yeah sorry everyone else didnt come I think theyre just tired With holes in their shoes And they have dysentery
228,8,8,Andy, Even without an audience youre still at it
229,8,8,Jim, What are you talking about
230,8,8,Andy, Our office has a disease And it goes by many names Sarcasm Snark Wisecracks You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes Thats what you did with this trip
231,8,8,Jim, Andy  this whole idea of our situation being just like wr Its just not true We just work at a paper company And youre our regional manager And guess what man You dont have to prove anything We like you as regional manager Andy if you dont believe me take a look at whats on my head Im wearing a very pink hat Ive been getting weird looks all day because Im pretty sure DM does GB means something kinda sexual But guess whos wearing them All of us Just for you man Thats huge
232,8,8,Andy, You dont like the hats
233,8,8,Jim, Theyre terrible
234,8,8,Darryl, I hate myself
235,8,8,Andy, They just didnt turn out how I wanted In my head they were cooler but they do look weird
236,8,8,Andy,  The world will little note nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and thats good because I was basically wrong I wanted my team to be like this army and I was their general But I guess its really more like theyre just people who work in an office and Im their manager Yeah thats really probably a better analogy now that I think about it
237,8,8,Gabe, Abe and Mary are seated watching the show  Oh Mary this is wonderful Ok Mary stop your scolding Ill be quiet  I need her like I need a hole in the head   BANG Ooh 
0,8,9,Dwight,  Oh little help Wow your hair is really thinning

53,8,9,Dwight, Obese people in my office are a drain on resources Chairs wear out faster it takes more Freon to keep them cool they flush the toilets more often plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes But a gym turns fat into cash
54,8,9,Andy, Alright The DM Express is pulling out

73,8,9,Dwight, Its the second easiest job in the world  Being a mom
74,8,9,Susan, I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that
75,8,9,Dwight, That is true

86,8,9,Dwight, Darryl 
87,8,9,Darryl, Make a real gym
88,8,9,Susan, I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping
89,8,9,Andy, But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is
90,8,9,Susan, Uh I could work in customer service HR even
91,8,9,Andy, Those are fully staffed as well

93,8,9,Andy,  Yes

186,8,9,Robert, Well thats a shame
187,8,9,Andy, It just was one of those things
188,8,9,Susan, Is it Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want Which is fine
189,8,9,Robert, Where did this come from Did Andy say that
190,8,9,Susan, No he did not but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him
191,8,9,Robert, Whats the struggle He made a great call hired a great person
192,8,9,Susan, You sure about that
193,8,9,Robert, Absolutely
194,8,9,Susan, No games
195,8,9,Robert, No games
196,8,9,Susan, Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me
197,8,9,Robert, Okay enough of this I mean really enough Its gotten way out of hand Andrew this is my wife Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us I thank you for But it is not welcome right now Just be honest

204,8,9,Andy, Okay I mean it was kind of funny actually Robert storms in and he says in four seconds my wifes gonna be in here I told her she could work here Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen 
205,8,9,Robert, You lying son of a bitch

209,8,9,Andy, No its not I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband Jim knows He was there
210,8,9,Robert, This is preposterous
211,8,9,Susan, Robert
212,8,9,Robert, Lets get Jim in here  Wheres Jim
213,8,9,Erin, He just rolled out and crawled out

236,8,9,Susan, For Gods sake did Robert tell you that he didnt want me working here
237,8,9,Jim, I feel that maybe if we take a step back this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse
238,8,9,Andy,  I think weve got ourselves an answer
239,8,9,Robert, No
240,8,9,Andy, That makes complete sense Thank you all for a wonderful day

117,8,14,Kelly, Why
118,8,14,Dwight, Oh no big deal Its just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee Florida
119,8,14,Kelly, Hell yeah
120,8,14,Stanley, What
121,8,14,Dwight, Oh Im sorry Stanley I cant share any more details with you You see Andy rejected you
122,8,14,Meredith, Wait Kathy gets to go Uh why does she even still work here Pam is back
123,8,14,Oscar, It just feels like a slap in the face
124,8,14,Dwight, I can understand your pain and your rage but you know what Andy is an honorable man let us not question his choices Im sure he had his reasons
125,8,14,Oscar, Were not questioning his reasons I just wanna know what they are
126,8,14,Dwight, I know you and me both brother It seemed kinda random to me but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime
127,8,14,Kevin, Well he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation Sometimes Batmans gotta take off his cape
128,8,14,Dwight, Good point But were gonna be working pretty hard until five PM After that its gonna be beach volleyball trips to Cape Canaveral and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan
129,8,14,Ryan, What are the criteria for going
130,8,14,Dwight, It might be innate goodness versus innate badness But theres an easy way to find out  Oh Andy gotta few questions for you
131,8,14,Andy, Mooshie mooshie 
132,8,14,Dwight, Uh the Florida picks got out and people were just kind of curious as to why they werent picked and maybe you could just clarify
133,8,14,Andy, Well uhwell the deliberations were confidential soI feel like we should respect that
134,8,14,Stanley, Respect it Youre trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson
135,8,14,Kevin, Hey
136,8,14,Angela, Ok its obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office
137,8,14,Kelly, Important Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch
138,8,14,Angela, My baby is not a monster
139,8,14,Dwight, Hey Be proud of your enormous monster baby I was once an enormous monster baby
140,8,14,Andy, Guys Guys Guys Come on seriously We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift guys
141,8,14,Ryan, Stop calling us guys

150,8,14,Andy, Wha
151,8,14,Stanley, If anybodys going to Florida it should be me Every shirt I have that isnt a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama Im the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice
152,8,14,Andy, OK I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida Im happy to hear you out
153,8,14,Dwight, Great idea So why doesnt everyone just take the next five to six hours come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it
154,8,14,Andy, No That is a ridiculous waste of time
155,8,14,Kelly, For you maybe
156,8,14,Andy, Five to six hours
157,8,14,Dwight, Three to four hours
158,8,14,Andy, No no no no
159,8,14,Dwight, Two to three hours
160,8,14,Andy, Nope
161,8,14,Dwight, Come up with a statement in the next hour
162,8,14,Andy, Thirty minutes
163,8,14,Creed, Im out
164,8,14,Pam, Ok read it back to me
165,8,14,Jim,  Robert great offer Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets

175,8,14,Ryan, You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends who know youth Thats myself and Kelly Kapoor you need one of us there

178,8,14,Andy, Very impressive He put a lot of work into that
179,8,14,Dwight, Mmhm Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world All show no meat
180,8,14,Kevin, Because I feel like that Im in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again You know just sitting watching enjoying the sport Maybe putting down a few dollars if theres like a crazy mismatch or something

195,8,14,Dwight, You know I dont think its a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality
196,8,14,Erin, Either or But if you can find someone to fill in I would love to go

265,8,14,Jim, So what is this special project
266,8,14,Dwight, Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace They want to set up their own version of an Apple store
267,8,14,Jim, That sounds awesome
268,8,14,Dwight, It did it did
269,8,14,Ryan, You know what might be great Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it
270,8,14,Erin, Yeah And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you dont have to carry it around like a dope Like a coat check  Oh dont write it down unless you like it
271,8,14,Dwight, Oh I like it
272,8,14,Ryan, How do we make this a better party
273,8,14,Dwight, No We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that They need to be all business Let all the other stores look like a toy store

87,8,17,Blogger, Okay
88,8,17,Nellie, I wasnt really sure which one of you is Chuck
89,8,17,Jim,  Yeah no it seems to be going great Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl
90,8,17,Blogger, Look at that guy Hes got his Sabre phone on and hes not even using it
91,8,17,Blogger 2, This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog

97,8,17,Nellie, We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day How hard would it have been to do this hmmm Hello Hi sweetie Its Jim Im calling you from the new Arrowhead which is why my voice is crystal clear And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape
98,8,17,Jim, Im really sorry Is there anything I can do maybe pretend to be Chuck
99,8,17,Dwight, You could have pretended to be Chuck I begged you to pretend to be Chuck but you chose to be yourself and you can no longer be Chuck Surrender the tripack You know what you have to do
100,8,17,Dwight, Point it towards the store idiot
101,8,17,Dwight,  You know what I mean One of these buttons is  damn it Take over
102,8,17,Dwight, Oh hey Hey hey you guys you must be lost Listen Excuse me sir Yeah the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank Tell your greatgrandson to bring his kid by Okay So long Here we go Erin Psst Come on The elderly suck the life out of the young Get them out of here
103,8,17,Erin, We are closed Come on
104,8,17,Toby, Selfdefense is not some fun boxing match okay This is about escaping with your life So strike scream and run All right Lets try it
105,8,17,Creed,   
106,8,17,Meredith, Ow
107,8,17,Toby, That may have been my fault
108,8,17,Meredith, What the hell Toby
109,8,17,Toby, Okay look in a real crisis situation youre not gonna have to time to think okay So just remember IAATG Its all about the groin
110,8,17,Andy, What if youre being attacked by a  smallish man who happens to not have a groin
111,8,17,Toby, I dont think thats very common
112,8,17,Andy, What if youre being attacked by a 411 man who is penisless
113,8,17,Oscar, Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker
114,8,17,Andy, Why dont we start with the basics Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby and then like a fifth grade girl and then you know if we have time on up to a scary man
115,8,17,Toby, Well the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female
116,8,17,Andy, So in that scenario what if the victim suckerpunches the attacker in the face What can the attacker then do to better protect himself
117,8,17,Toby, Its interesting that youre drawn to the point of view of the attacker You would like the turn of the table Okay the latest Chad Flenderman novel  written from the point of view of his nemesis Dr Lucifer Wu
118,8,17,Angela, Can I please leave I have a rpe flute
119,8,17,Toby, All right well lets try one simple technique together Okay why doesnt everyone stand Okay so youre being attacked Youve got your hands up Simple palm strike to the chin Up to the chin One two
120,8,17,Everyone, One two
121,8,17,Andy,  Take that kid
122,8,17,Dwight, Cathy I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome He is a freelancer for Wired magazine

135,8,17,Ryan, God I wish Kelly were here She always knew what to say
136,8,17,Dwight, Um  Oh Ryan youre so smart Youre smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined Hee hee hee
137,8,17,Ryan, Youre so ignorant You barely know what youre talking about That is so ridiculous You really need to read a couple books
138,8,17,Dwight, Whats a book 
139,8,17,Ryan, On my God Youre so embarrassing My mom would say the best stuff though
140,8,17,Jim,  You can  You can do it Ryan
141,8,17,Ryan, And you know that Im capable of this
142,8,17,Jim, Youre the only one who can do it ssweetie
143,8,17,Ryan, What did you think of the presentation
144,8,17,Jim, I thought it was great sweetie I would just fix that one 
145,8,17,Ryan, Oh Fix means you hate it I knew it I need something to drink
146,8,17,Dwight, Jim get him a water
147,8,17,Ryan, No not a water A sports drink I hate everything in that fridge Not red Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store Not red
148,8,17,Dwight, Why are you just standing there Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink
149,8,17,Toby, Now if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that youre alive
150,8,17,Lady, Forgive me for interrupting I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice
151,8,17,Andy,  I think you guys might have the wrong Office
152,8,17,Girl, Thats him the guy I hit

167,8,17,Lady, God bless Friend of mine uses your paper You do good work Bye bye
168,8,17,Kevin, Bye
169,8,17,Kelly, So Toby I think we should do a different selfdefense seminar  How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls
170,8,17,Toby, Theres no shame in getting beaten up by a girl My exwife used to demolish me
171,8,17,Kelly, No there is shame in it okay We have to draw the line somewhere
172,8,17,Darryl, Oh my God I think I see the imprint of a ring pop

7,8,18,Phyllis, If Dwights not coming back does that mean we can open his treasure
8,8,18,Oscar, You guys weve gone over this there is no treasure 
9,8,18,Oscar, When the team left for Tallahassee Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure  Obviously he wants us to obsess about it Theres nothing in there  Which is obviously what he would want us to think making it the perfect place to hide a treasure Oh god Im Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride
10,8,18,Andy, I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure 
11,8,18,Oscar, I am dying to know whats in there
12,8,18,Andy, Yeah I know Oscar we all are but nobodys gonna open it Youd have to be insane

86,8,18,Robert California, Well the store is lovely You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line Great job Cheers
87,8,18,Jim, Thank you
88,8,18,Robert California, But theres a reason we sell our products online and overthephone Have you ever used Sabre electronics Jim  Theyre cheap Theyre unintuitive The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyones wives do us
89,8,18,Jim, Wow When you put it that way I guess it does sound pretty terrible
90,8,18,Robert California, I couldnt just kll the project from the start Jo Bennett endorsed it Shame though I did like Dwight
91,8,18,Dwight,  Robert Im gonna win ha ha Im the gentleman Suck it
92,8,18,Robert California,  Bravo Dwight Very good   Shame
93,8,18,Dwight,  The math is simple folks Deeper market penetration plus greater visibility will raise Sabre   to the power of two
94,8,18,Nellie, How did that look
95,8,18,Gabe, Im not just saying this that was the best thing Ive ever seen
96,8,18,Dwight,  I told you

243,8,18,Dwight,  Once again its show time
244,8,18,Robert California, What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea  which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on and then utterly botch it in execution
245,8,18,Todd Packer, If I may speak to that I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour so the man you want is Dwight Shrute
246,8,18,Robert California, I dont see Dwight He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible
247,8,18,Nellie, Whatever you do do not blame Todd Packer It is not his fault Blame his upbringing his parents the society that would mold this idiotic creature Fire the employee yes but not the man You may not cancel his soul
248,8,18,Robert California, That was never on the table
249,8,18,Todd Packer,  Are you kidding  Shes the queen of the whole freaking Magilla
250,8,18,Robert California, And yet Todd its you whos fired
251,8,18,Todd Packer, What you I I cant get fired Im an institution I have been at this company for 20 years How many of you have been here that long huh

92,8,19,Robert, We live in this world of routines and rhythms Kevin ate someones lunch Phyllis has a new necklace Who is this woman
93,8,19,Nellie, I came in here simply trying to get to know you learn your names maybe have someone teach me the company song And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way
94,8,19,Kevin, Hot tub party
95,8,19,Nellie, Performance reviews
96,8,19,Pam, How can you give us performance reviews if you dont know us

102,8,19,Erin, So you came to get me but you still have a girlfriend
103,8,19,Irene, I think you should leave young man
104,8,19,Andy, All right Technically yes I am still technically dating Jessica But when I realized that I wanted you back I just jumped in the car and I drove down here and I didnt want to stop until I saw you
105,8,19,Erin, You didnt even stop to pee Gross
106,8,19,Jim, Any luck

109,8,19,Erin, Oh youre doing so good Oh my God youre superman over there 
110,8,19,Irene, You should take it Its probably your girlfriend wondering where you are
111,8,19,Andy, Nope Its just work Not important You know I can really feel this is my quads I can tell Im getting stronger
112,8,19,Irene, You really wouldnt feel those kinds of results after one session
113,8,19,Andy, I dont know  Just let it vibrate Its fine
114,8,19,Irene, You could put it on silent
115,8,19,Andy, I dont think it does that
116,8,19,Irene, Just go to preferences then click 
117,8,19,Glenn,  Proctology

122,8,19,Irene, Hes here in Tallahassee trying to turn my life upside down
123,8,19,Jim, What Youre in Florida Andy Nellie Bertrams trying to take your job
124,8,19,Andy, What do you mean take my job
125,8,19,Jim, Like set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager
126,8,19,Andy, Okay Jim I really appreciate you looking out for me but Im not coming home without Erin So Ill talk to you later
127,8,19,Jim, Guys we cannot do these performance reviews okay If we go into them youre basically accepting Nellie as your manager and trust me you do not want her as your manager
128,8,19,Angela, Trust you The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldnt have to work
129,8,19,Pam, I like working here
130,8,19,Jim, Dwight should she be our manager
131,8,19,Dwight, I wouldnt let her manage a celery farm
132,8,19,Dwight, Those who cant farm farm celery
133,8,19,Jim, And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever 
134,8,19,Nellie, All right Lets get going First up it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet Phyllis
135,8,19,Phyllis, Nellie Im sorry but I dont feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I dont know
136,8,19,Nellie, Oh Oh okay I understand Let me show you how these are gonna go Dwight
137,8,19,Dwight, I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect I lost respect for you in Florida If it was up to me you would be in jail forever
138,8,19,Nellie, Dwight I have completed your evaluation Youre getting a raise
139,8,19,Dwight, What
140,8,19,Nellie, Dwight you carry this company on your massive shoulders You are our Atlas and for that do you not think you deserve a raise
141,8,19,Dwight, Theres no limit to what I think I deserve
142,8,19,Nellie, Then you accept it
143,8,19,Dwight, Five percent No less
144,8,19,Nellie, Absolutely not Seven percent
145,8,19,Dwight, Six percent I know my worth
146,8,19,Jim, The raise isnt real
147,8,19,Dwight, Money isnt real ever since we got off the gold standard
148,8,19,Nellie, So Phyllis now you know the rules of the game Would you care to have a go Im fairly certain youre going to like it
149,8,19,Pam, Phyllis
150,8,19,Phyllis, Pam
151,8,19,Nellie, So Phyllis I have been very impressed with you
152,8,19,Phyllis, Really
153,8,19,Nellie, Oh yeah The way you conquered your fear and came in here and now the way you sit there all very impressive
154,8,19,Jim, Um are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises
155,8,19,Robert, I am not Huh
156,8,19,Jim, Yeah She gave one to Dwight Phyllis
157,8,19,Robert, Let me guess you want one too Take the family to Disneytown
158,8,19,Jim, Land World Uh its not that I dont want a well yes I guess Id take a raise Thats not what Im saying Thats not sorry
159,8,19,Robert, Jim I told Andy to come in and yet he is still not in By contrast Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett my boss
160,8,19,Jim, Yes
161,8,19,Robert, Jim would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor
162,8,19,Jim, Oh god nature please
163,8,19,Robert, When two animals are having sx one of them
164,8,19,Jim, 
165,8,19,Robert,  is communicating a message to the other Nothing is mutua this isnt very helpful Youre gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor
166,8,19,Jim, Was that not the
167,8,19,Robert, All life is sx And all sx is competition
168,8,19,Jim, Mmhm
169,8,19,Robert, And there are no rules to that game That wasnt so perverted now was it
170,8,19,Jim, Was that it No that wasnt bad
171,8,19,Robert, My point is there is one person in charge of every office in America and that person is Charles Darwin In the end doesnt he decide who the manager is
172,8,19,Jim, No I wouldve said no
173,8,19,Nellie, Mm lets see review review review Yes good stuff Here you go have a raise
174,8,19,Kelly, Oh great
175,8,19,Jim, I mean if we go in there and take these raises what are we saying That its okay for someone to just take someone elses job Shouldnt work like that
176,8,19,Dwight, No you know what Nellies right That is exactly how it should work Darryl this office is mine now
177,8,19,Darryl, No
178,8,19,Dwight, Yes
179,8,19,Darryl, No
180,8,19,Dwight, Yes
181,8,19,Darryl, No
182,8,19,Dwight, Yes
183,8,19,Darryl, No
184,8,19,Dwight, Yes
185,8,19,Darryl, No
186,8,19,Dwight, Yes Yes sorry too late Im here This is mine Back off
187,8,19,Dwight,  Ow Ow ow ow Ow ow ow Ow
188,8,19,Dwight,  Well fought I accept the outcome
189,8,19,Creed, Touch me and Ill sue
190,8,19,Erin, Ive heard thats amazing when it works
191,8,19,Andy, Yeah if I had my own
192,8,19,Erin, Andy I care about you and I think
193,8,19,Andy, sorry you go
194,8,19,Erin, No go ahead
195,8,19,Andy, Well I was just going to say that if I had my own fountain it would be two frogs that are spitting into each others mouth Its just stupid What were you going to say
196,8,19,Erin, Andy you broke my heart Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else
197,8,19,Andy, You broke my heart too
198,8,19,Erin, You broke my heart more recently and more often And I think at some point in my head it just sort of clicked that were not meant to be
199,8,19,Andy, Im so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time
200,8,19,Erin, I know
201,8,19,Andy, 
202,8,19,Nellie, So Pamela Im going to start this review not by telling you what you lack but rather asking you what it is you want
203,8,19,Pam, Really Okay well um I like consistency in the managers position no weird silent coups Stuff like that Im easy
204,8,19,Nellie, Thats not really what you want What you want is a good nights sleep working mother of two
205,8,19,Pam, Whoa thats kind of condescending Would you say something like that to Jim
206,8,19,Nellie, Does Jim have to breastfeed Did Jim carry around those babies for what is it 12 months Be honest does Jim really get up in the night
207,8,19,Pam, Well I mean the only reason he doesnt is because Im breastfeeding and Phillip doesnt like a bottle
208,8,19,Nellie, You must be exhausted Fancy a nap
209,8,19,Pam, No
210,8,19,Nellie, Go on Have a nap Lie down right here Theres a blanket in here I used it earlier myself Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau No one will know Ill wake you up And when you wake up you will earn more money
211,8,19,Pam, I think youre a witch
212,8,19,Nellie, Im amazing
213,8,19,Pam,  Im amazing 
214,8,19,Irene, Erin I think youre making a big mistake right now Andy is a nice boy
215,8,19,Erin, Really cause youve been kind of a B to him all afternoon
216,8,19,Irene, I was protecting you because I thought he was no good But I can tell you really like him And hes willing to lose his job for you in this economy with Europe on the brink
217,8,19,Erin, Irene what would you do without me
218,8,19,Irene, Were not your concern sweetheart Besides Glenns going to sue Home Depot
219,8,19,Erin, Why
220,8,19,Irene, He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture
221,8,19,Nellie, Jim time for your review
222,8,19,Jim, No its not because you dont really work here
223,8,19,Nellie, Why are you so staunchly defending your friend who has abandoned you Wouldnt you rather come talk with me Maybe definitely get a raise
224,8,19,Jim, Yeah thats the thing I dont know if you can even give raises
225,8,19,Nellie, Jim have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell
226,8,19,Jim, Yes
227,8,19,Nellie, Im Tinkerbell
228,8,19,Jim, No
229,8,19,Nellie, Mmhm Im a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives to give you all raises
230,8,19,Stanley, And we are grateful
231,8,19,Nellie, But heres the thing about Tinkerbell Jim Everyone has to believe in her or she doesnt exist
232,8,19,Jim, She dies
233,8,19,Nellie, She dies Now who here believes in Tinkerbell
234,8,19,Jim, Lets see it Show of hands

242,8,19,Andy, That did not go how I wanted it to Ugh I have a whole ton of Erins favorite food for the drive back eggplant parm  Its biodegradable Animals will eat it
243,8,19,Erin, Andy wait  Andy Andy wait Dont go Andy I love you Stop Oh this is the wrong Prius I dont love you Im sorry

258,8,19,Erin, I always find one Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush
259,8,19,Andy, Of course I own my toothbrush
260,8,19,Nellie, I grew up poor I had little formal education No real skills I dont work especially hard and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap And yet I walked right into a job for which I was illprepared illsuited and somebody else already had and I got it If you ask me thats the American dream right there Anything can happen to anyone Its just random

134,8,20,Jim, Boyfriend
135,8,20,Dwight, Heres the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower Im guessing hes some kind of close romantic friend
136,8,20,Jim, Like a boyfriend
137,8,20,Dwight, You read my mind
138,8,20,Jim, Yeah Whoa Heres one with his face whited out
139,8,20,Dwight, Hmm Maybe someone threw a pie in his face New theory hes a hated Italian politician
140,8,20,Jim, Better theory This is her exboyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup
141,8,20,Nellie,  Oh
142,8,20,Jim, Oh Nellie Im so sorry We were just

148,8,20,Jim, Dwight
149,8,20,Nellie, I couldnt afford the flat myself So I sold it at a loss Ah but whats ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one
150,8,20,Jim, Im so sorry These must be very painful memories
151,8,20,Dwight, If it would help you to forget I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick
152,8,20,Nellie, Thank you No Look Jim Dwight please dont tell anyone about this
153,8,20,Jim, No no Of course Just one quick question Was this um Halloween or
154,8,20,Nellie, God no Thats the most embarrassing thing of all this What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician
155,8,20,Jim,  You know what Pam I was thinking maybe we should change course here Lets give up on all this mean stuff
156,8,20,Pam, What No No I just had this brilliant idea everyone loved it You dont have a copyright on pranks I might be better at this than you

215,8,20,Jessica, Youre breaking up with me
216,8,20,Andy, Uh no No You always do this You twist my words around Part of me thinks we should just end this right now
217,8,20,Jessica, Oh my God Are you leaving me for Erin You said she wasnt relationship material and she wasnt as good as me but its her isnt it
218,8,20,Andy, Whoa That No Okay You want honesty Superhonesty time Im gay

225,8,20,Jessica, Andy youre not gay I mean we were together And you seemed pretty excitable
226,8,20,Andy, Well I was faking it I had to fake it every time I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos
227,8,20,Jessica, I cant say it doesnt make sense
228,8,20,Andy, Well I mean I was good at hiding it but
229,8,20,Jessica, Look its fine Andy I didnt think we were gonna get married or anything I just Im just upset for now
230,8,20,Andy, Understandable And Im really sorry I really am  So we should probably go
231,8,20,Robert, This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague Excellent
232,8,20,Oscar, To Nellie Bertram you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company
233,8,20,Robert, Cheers
234,8,20,Nellie, Why thank you
235,8,20,Oscar, Pam on the other hand is a most unwelcome entitled unfriendly presence in our company
236,8,20,All, Cheers
237,8,20,Angela, Nellie is terrific but to be honest every day I imagine how happy Id be if Pam died 
238,8,20,Jim, Oh Well I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit enough A good amount Not the most though I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe theres some stuff in her past that you guys dont know about thats a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with
239,8,20,Creed, We hate Pam We hate Pam
240,8,20,All, We hate Pam We hate Pam
241,8,20,Magician, So weve established

266,8,20,Jim, Not true Cause thats not a real place
267,8,20,Magician, But I never could seem to figure out those knots

31,8,21,Dwight, Nellie let me bobbleize him His name is now Captain Mutato
32,8,21,Dwight, Ive written quite a bit of XMen fan fiction Captain Mutato is half man half mermaid So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid Most of my writing involves the latter

38,8,21,Nellie, You are most welcome
39,8,21,Andy, Anyway now that Im back I would love to have my office back whenever you get a chance
40,8,21,Nellie, No
41,8,21,Andy, Obviously well figure out the uh logistics of moving all this stuff out of here But you know the sooner the better
42,8,21,Nellie, Mmhmm
43,8,21,Andy, Get back to normalcy
44,8,21,Nellie, Hmm no
45,8,21,Ravi, and then just lay him in his crib and then bicycle his legs And then after Jim quiets down you do the same thing with your baby  But if he keeps having problems just give me a call
46,8,21,Pam, Oh my gosh thank you so much But seriously we dont want to bother you any more than we already have
47,8,21,Jim, Thats it
48,8,21,Kelly, Its no bother you guys are our friends
49,8,21,Pam, Ravi our amazing pediatrician was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl
50,8,21,Jim, Yep Because Kelly is Indian and oh thats it
51,8,21,Pam, Race had nothing to do with it I just knew theyd be good together
52,8,21,Pam,  Kelly has been a handful in the past
53,8,21,Kelly,  Why
54,8,21,Pam,  But shes had a bad influence Shes like an addict  And I just had to get her clean
55,8,21,Kevin,  Get lower
56,8,21,Ryan, Um also little tip never shake the baby
57,8,21,Jim, Sorry just to be clear youre saying do NOT shake the baby
58,8,21,Ryan, Dont shake the baby Um a lot of times parents get frustrated cause the babys crying and they shake the baby And you got to um you cant do that
59,8,21,Pam, Dont shake our baby
60,8,21,Ryan, Yeah
61,8,21,Pam, Okay Id never heard that before So thank you
62,8,21,Ryan, Oh my God
63,8,21,Pam, Yeah Im glad you said something
64,8,21,Ryan, Me too
65,8,21,Ryan, Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants And her new boyfriend seems awesome if youre into Indian people Im not
66,8,21,Ryan, Hey um whats the deal with this guy Hes really into Kelly huh
67,8,21,Pam, Yeah theyre really great together
68,8,21,Ryan, Maybe we werent right together but its weird Id rather she be alone than with somebody Is that love
69,8,21,Jim, Thats about it yeah
70,8,21,Robert, Nellie Youve been terrific in your interim capacity But Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office
71,8,21,Nellie, No
72,8,21,Robert, Im sorry
73,8,21,Andy, This is what I was trying to tell you
74,8,21,Robert, Im not accustomed to people saying no to me 
75,8,21,Nellie, Well Bobby get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes
76,8,21,Robert, Youre both adults Im sure you can figure this out between yourselves
77,8,21,Robert, I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until Ive had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally Buffett operates the same way
78,8,21,Nellie, Im gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office Im going to dock your pay one hundred dollars
79,8,21,Andy,  Okay
80,8,21,Nellie, Five four

104,8,21,Erin, We both were Plus I was definitely not my normal sexy self
105,8,21,Andy, Whoa No Are you kidding You were so sexy Just the thought of you last night like crazy turns me on It just didnt last night
106,8,21,Erin, Really Its not a big deal
107,8,21,Andy, Yeah I know its not a big deal
108,8,21,Ryan, I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you
109,8,21,Kelly, Oh those are from our weekend at the time share
110,8,21,Ryan, Yeah the fractional ownership property  Oh we took this one right before we got in that huge fight
111,8,21,Kelly, God I dont even remember what that fight was about
112,8,21,Ryan, You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner But all I remember is how pretty you looked taking those pictures of me Anyway if you want to order prints of your own I can send you the link
113,8,21,Ryan, Im in love with Kelly Kapoor And I dont know how Im gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that but I do know that right here right now all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her Again that could change
114,8,21,Erin, When you lost the manager job
115,8,21,Dwight, Yes
116,8,21,Erin, Did it affect you outside of the office
117,8,21,Dwight, How
118,8,21,Erin, I dont know what the technical term is Penial softiosis
119,8,21,Dwight, Erin I am so glad that you trusted me You came to the exact right person for this No I have never once experienced anything remotely like that Never
120,8,21,Erin, Oh okay
121,8,21,Dwight, Okay
122,8,21,Erin, Okay
123,8,21,Dwight, Washington Monument
124,8,21,Erin, Oh
125,8,21,Dwight, Eiffel Tower
126,8,21,Erin, Okay okay
127,8,21,Pam, I saw you were getting along with Ryan again
128,8,21,Kelly, Hes so sweet He pointed to my latte and he said Kelly that will be the color of our children
129,8,21,Pam, Yeah hes so great Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though
130,8,21,Kelly, Which time
131,8,21,Pam, I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician Why you would even ask or were going to ask because I I felt like that question was coming
132,8,21,Dwight, One of Tobys eyes is getting smaller So theres that Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket So Ill keep you posted on that
133,8,21,Dwight, Every day I brief Nellie on whats going on in the office Most of its irrelevant But a good informer doesnt judge whats worth passing on
134,8,21,Dwight, Oh and Andy lost his masculinity so congratulations on that
135,8,21,Nellie, What do you mean
136,8,21,Dwight, Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night By contrast I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all Wow I knew youd win but you just demolished him Im a little bit jealous actually Reduced him to a mere ant
137,8,21,Nellie, I just wanted to take the mans job not his manhood
138,8,21,Nellie, Okay I would like to invite everyone into the conference room
139,8,21,Andy, You cant call a meeting  But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now So lets get in the conference room Thank you Good Thank you for coming to my meeting

142,8,21,Nellie, No
143,8,21,Andy, Wanted to talk to all of you guys about  importance and know that each and every one of you is vitally important
144,8,21,Robert, Andrew not everyone here is important And the word is impotence
145,8,21,Nellie, Which is important in its own way So if youd just like to take a seat Andy
146,8,21,Nellie, Take a mans job but leave him his balls Margaret Thatcher said that probably Dont know Dont read Didnt see the movie
147,8,21,Nellie, This meeting is not about any one person in particular It is a human problem
148,8,21,Dwight, Its not just a human problem Flounders frequently experience impotence especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male
149,8,21,Oscar, Nellie does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular
150,8,21,Nellie, Oh oh its not me No no Ive never had any problem in that arena And I have been with several older men

180,8,21,Jim, Couple of times
181,8,21,Robert, Jim maybe you could tell us about one of those times

188,8,21,Phyllis, Fortythree was ju I got nothing done 
189,8,21,Gabe, Ive read and I dont know anything about this personally but they say prostate stimulation can help
190,8,21,Angela, Ugh

198,8,21,Erin, Toby doesnt HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff
199,8,21,Toby, Erin HR is a joke I cant do anything about anything
200,8,21,Nellie, The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this Stress just makes it worse and then you stress more And thats a vicious spiral
201,8,21,Robert, I almost didnt come in today 
202,8,21,Andy,  Dad dont think of it as a demotion Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level I dont think you have to tell your friends anything It hasnt been decided yet
203,8,21,Nellie, Erin on phone memos youre writing the date American style Month day year I prefer it day month year Small bigger biggest Oh sexual innuendo Not intentional
204,8,21,Erin, Shut up Shut up I am sick of your dumb opinions And if you dont like the way that I take phone messages here  Take em yourself
205,8,21,Andy, Oh and another thing Our sx life is none of your businesses
206,8,21,Erin, And Andy is the manager not Nellie
207,8,21,Andy, Stop protecting me Im a man I can protect myself This is misdirected anger and Im sorry I dont mean to lash out at you Theres a lot coming up right now all at once  Dad go to hell Im taller than you
208,8,21,Nellie, Okay just calm down
209,8,21,Andy, You are not the manager I earned that job I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit
210,8,21,Robert, Andy why dont you just take a seat
211,8,21,Andy, Why dont you take a seat you idiot 
212,8,21,Erin, And why dont you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels
213,8,21,Andy, And your stupid face  And your stupid office  Ah
214,8,21,Darryl, He does not like that wall
215,8,21,Erin, Maybe well get sent to anger management together

218,8,21,Ryan, Hey I hear you been badmouthing me to Kelly
219,8,21,Pam, All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly
220,8,21,Ryan, Well thats your opinion and its her opinion but its not my opinion If you have something bad to say to me Pam say it to my face
221,8,21,Pam, I dont like you very much
222,8,21,Ryan, Well a lot of people would say that Im a better match for Kelly than Ravi is
223,8,21,Oscar, Oh come on Ryan Really Ravis way better
224,8,21,Ryan, For Kelly
225,8,21,Kevin, Yeah Man youre insane right now Ravis the whole package

234,8,21,Oscar, Ryan go away She found herself a beautiful boyfriend
235,8,21,Kevin, Yeah man hes absolutely gorgeous Please leave her alone
236,8,21,Ryan, You see Kelly Our love scares them It screws up their cookiecutter world
237,8,21,Kelly, Ravi makes me incredibly happy And Ryan puts me through so much drama So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me

80,8,23,Harry, You live well down here in PA I want to talk to you guys right now Oh and Lloyd Gross too Which ones that guy
81,8,23,Jim, The salesmen have a commission cap but we figured out a way around it
82,8,23,Dwight, Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to  how do I put this  steal from the company Embezzle To commit fraud
83,8,23,Jim, Okay it sounds sketchy but it helps us get more money
84,8,23,Dwight, Yes
85,8,23,Jim, Pam made a drawing of Lloyd He is a blend of all the salesman 
86,8,23,Dwight,  There he is Thats Lloyd

90,8,23,Toby, Now were actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are Kimosabe
91,8,23,Toby, I like to think Lloyd Gross is a nononsense guy who doesnt back down from anybody And he calls people Kimosabe
92,8,23,Harry, Theyre New York Were New York Sate line is the dividing line Thats the way its always been
93,8,23,Jim, Theres actually not a rule that says that
94,8,23,Dwight, Thats true
95,8,23,Toby, Thats true Theres no rule You can check the employee handbook Oh can I check the employee handbook Lloyd Well does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands
96,8,23,Toby, No
97,8,23,Dwight, Wait no Are you kidding me You told me there was a rule I couldve choked so many people by now
98,8,23,Harry, Stay out of my state Its in your best interest to stay out of my state
99,8,23,Toby, Ive seen guys like you Big guys who like to push the little guys around Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast
100,8,23,Harry, Just stay out of New York Lloyd
101,8,23,Toby, Hey text from the old wife Gonna take that 
102,8,23,Jim, How about this How about we just ask Robert Can we all agree that maybe the CEO should decide this
103,8,23,Harry, Roberts here Look at us Bickering like schoolgirls looking around the room for things to hit each other with I dont think we were doing that
104,8,23,Dwight, Chair lamp plant table leg Jims leg
105,8,23,Robert, Wheres the Advil Jim I think Ive hit my limit on the Tylenol  Oh
106,8,23,Andy,  Sorry not Jim
107,8,23,Robert, Andrew what do we have to do to get rid of you Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida
108,8,23,Andy, Message received loud and clear Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries
109,8,23,Robert, Oh for god 
110,8,23,Harry, Robert California What a surprise youre here in Scranton
111,8,23,Robert, Harry
112,8,23,Harry, So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place
113,8,23,Robert, How do you mean
114,8,23,Andy, I forgot a a pan uh 
115,8,23,Harry, No no no no no kid stay there do your dishes go ahead
116,8,23,Robert, Harry there is a time for every decision predetermined many years ago Theres no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems so poorly timed
117,8,23,Dwight, Okay what are you deciding We get a say
118,8,23,Harry, Listen Robert I dont have time Theres a big client in play Prestige direct mail solutions 
119,8,23,Dwight, Dont listen to him
120,8,23,Harry, Used to be Binghamtons 
121,8,23,Dwight, Nope
122,8,23,Harry, I want it its mine
123,8,23,Dwight, Prestige is ours Okay theyre responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard We get them We already put a call into them Robert
124,8,23,Harry, We need you to make a decision
125,8,23,Dwight, Make a decision
126,8,23,Robert, I have decided Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up As Solomon once said 
127,8,23,Andy, Some bizarre energy in this place today Robert is going off the rails making some funky decisions Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige That is a huge client  I mean they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door Could be any idiot Any idiot at all
128,8,23,Robert, Shaping a company is in a sense similar to training a geisha You have to mold not merely the physical form but also the character The two must harmonize Are they still there  They want a decision who gets the big client Well they can wait Ill still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime You know I trained as one
129,8,23,Harry, Is it just me or is our boss a freakin weirdo  Im gonna get some air
130,8,23,Dwight, Jim you know what would be really dastardly If we snuck out of here and got to the client first
131,8,23,Jim,  Hes running
132,8,23,Dwight, Damn it
133,8,23,Jim, Damn it

33,5,3,Michael, Ok lets give it for Miss Holly Flaaaax 
34,5,3,Holly, Thanks Michael  Today were going to have a business ethics seminar because recently without mentioning any names there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired
35,5,3,Kevin, Oh come on Hes right there  He was hired  Oh check it out Hired Guy
36,5,3,Jim, Nice 
37,5,3,Ryan, Ok elephant in the room Lets talk about it Do I regret what I did Of course I do Even though it was an amazing ride and Ill give you an example Anyone see Survivor season six  Anyone know Joanna on that show  In New York City I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that Indistinguishable So
38,5,3,Michael,  Ok Well done Good speech Ryan youre a good guy
39,5,3,Holly, Lets start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours Now some of you marked that you very strongly agree But ideally you would have selected totally agree
40,5,3,Phyllis, I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree
41,5,3,Holly, Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement
42,5,3,Michael, Well I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic 
43,5,3,Holly, Thank you In fact spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing
44,5,3,Kelly, What
45,5,3,Holly, Yes its called time theft and its the same as taking money from the company Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters
46,5,3,Stanley, This meeting
47,5,3,Andy, Heyoh
48,5,3,Dwight, Yes
49,5,3,Michael,  Cant set em up like that
50,5,3,Kelly, Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour then Ill just take up smoking Ill do it I dont care
51,5,3,Meredith, Ill smoke with you I got a bag of cigars in my purse
52,5,3,Holly, Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about
53,5,3,Michael, Can we have a moment  Can I talk to you for a sec Lot of good stuff And you look you look fantastic
54,5,3,Dight, Michael
55,5,3,Michael, Yeah
56,5,3,Dwight, What should we be working on while you guys are talking
57,5,3,Michael, Do some do some work  People expect a lot from these meetings Laughter sudden twists Surprise endings You need to be Robin Williams and M Night Shyamalan You need to be Robin Shyamalan
58,5,3,Holly, Well I just have to get through the binder
59,5,3,Michael, Do you just youre kind of losing them
60,5,3,Holly, I am
61,5,3,Micheal, Yeah dont think about the stakes Itll freak you out
62,5,3,Holly, Ok  Michael makes a really good point so uh lets just open this up a little bit Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil Thats not right
63,5,3,Michael,  Lauren  enough with the pencils
64,5,3,Holly, No I have to go over pencils and office supplies Its part of the ethics thing
65,5,3,Oscar, That isnt ethics Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good This is just the corporate antishoplifting rules
66,5,3,Andy, Ill drop an ethics bmb on you Would you steal bread to feed your family  Boom
67,5,3,Oscar, Exactly Andy
68,5,3,Andy, Yeah I took intro to philosophy twice No big deal
69,5,3,Dwight, Its a trick question The bread is poisoned Also its not your real family Youve been cuckolded by a stronger smarter male
70,5,3,Andy, No thats not how it works
71,5,3,Michael, I would not steal the bread And I would not let my family go hungry
72,5,3,Holly, Ok but we should get back to business Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace
73,5,3,Michael, Anybody This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions Stanley Oscar come on
74,5,3,Oscar, Pass
75,5,3,Michael, I will go first When I discovered YouTube I didnt work for five days I did nothing I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times
76,5,3,Holly, What was the dilemma
77,5,3,Michael, To tell you or not And Im glad I did I feel very very good Cathartic I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity
78,5,3,Holly, Oh no no no
79,5,3,Michael, Yeah  Come on anybody Let it fly
80,5,3,Oscar, Ok once in a while Ill take a long lunch

95,5,3,Jim, Jackpot
96,5,3,Michael, Ach Wuh
97,5,3,Holly, Meredith that is serious I mean not only that a conflict of interests theres also an exchange of goods
98,5,3,Meredith, Exchange of steak Have you ever had sirloin steak honey
99,5,3,Michael, Thats crazy Thats crazy talk Meredith The Merenator sleepin with suppliers Hooooh Wow What time we got  You know what Thats a good place to end it Right there This I think was a great ethics seminar She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about Right what is wrong Whos to say Really In the end I mean because it is unknowable But lets give her a round of applause Holly everybody Holly Get back to work   Great job I am truly impressed That uh you really pulled that one out Classic Classic meeting We should celebrate
100,5,3,Holly, Michael there is some serious issues with Meredith
101,5,3,Michael, Oh
102,5,3,Holly, I mean all of you have done things I wouldnt have done myself but Merediths actions are really over the line
103,5,3,Micheal, Nnyeah What ya gonna do
104,5,3,Holly, So regarding this supplier approximately how many liaisons have there been
105,5,3,Meredith, Liaisons you mean meetups I dont know once a month for six years Something like that
106,5,3,Michael, Meredith why dont you tell Holly its not what she thinks Nothing unethical happened and that you just like to sleep around
107,5,3,Meredith, Am I in trouble here or something
108,5,3,Michael, No no this is just a stupid formality
109,5,3,Holly, No its not a formality Now were these um meetups just personal Unrelated to business
110,5,3,Meredith, Nah I wouldnt have done it if it wasnt for the discount paper Theres not a lot of fruit in those looms
111,5,3,Micheal, Ughh For the love of God were trying to help you stupid bag
112,5,3,Holly, What I dont understand is why the steak coupons I mean if you were already getting the discounted paper
113,5,3,Meredith,Well its funny Maybe its a girl thing but after we did it and he would give me those coupons I just felt good about myself  Hey whats going on here I thought I had immunity
114,5,3,Holly, Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace I mean Ive never heard of anyone whos kept their job after something like this
115,5,3,Meredith, Well Im not quitting
116,5,3,Jim,  Yawn Four seconds

125,5,3,Michael, Hooooh Reaching Youll get there Anyway I was giving it some thought and theres no reason that two attractive good looking intelligent funny attractive people cant you know just sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out
126,5,3,Holly, Sounds good
127,5,3,Michael, Good Would you care to bang it out over lunch
128,5,3,Holly, Oh I already bought this
129,5,3,Michael, Oh no no no Your food is no good here my lady  Sorry You know what Lets go out Dunder Mifflins treat Um actually youre not a client so well just split it Ethical
130,5,3,Holly, So Ive gone over corporate policy
131,5,3,Michael, What do you think What do you think of this place
132,5,3,Holly, Oh its very nice
133,5,3,Michael, Istnt it Yeah its kind of businessromantic So youre from Des Moines
134,5,3,Holly, Mmm
135,5,3,Michael, Wow that sounds so warm
136,5,3,Holly, In Summer
137,5,3,Michael, Here too You know what my favorite season is
138,5,3,Holly, Maybe we should talk about Meredith first
139,5,3,Michael, Yeah get the boring stuff out of the way Autumn was what I was going to say When the leaves change Its just I I think it is the most contemplative of seasons
140,5,3,Holly, Ok so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just dont think there is any way I can write a report that doesnt end with her being terminated
141,5,3,Michael, Wow terminator terminator
142,5,3,Holly, Im from da future
143,5,3,Michael, Yeah
144,5,3,Jim, Hey Andy
145,5,3,Andy, Yo
146,5,3,Jim, By any chance did you see Battlestar Galactica last night
147,5,3,Andy, No I did not Was that any good
148,5,3,Jim, Actually not It was really soso
149,5,3,Dwight, Ok 
150,5,3,Jim, I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff You know like klingons and wookies and all that but  Sorry was there something you wanted to add Dwight
151,5,3,Andy, Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica
152,5,3,Jim, You know its weird Its practically a shot for shot remake
153,5,3,Andy, Really  Huh thats cool
154,5,3,Jim, Storys kinda bland Its about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor
155,5,3,Andy, Really That doesnt sound right
156,5,3,Michael, I just dont want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance I mean what sort of place is that to call home And Meredith needs this job This is her main source of money
157,5,3,Holly, Well thats very sweet but we have to follow the protocol Those are the rules
158,5,3,Michael, Ok new idea We dont report it at all We just punish her
159,5,3,Holly, We punish her
160,5,3,Michael, Mmhmm tell her she cant have sx for six months
161,5,3,Holly, I dont think we could enforce that
162,5,3,Michael, I dont know I saw this thing like a belt with a key
163,5,3,Holly, A chastity belt
164,5,3,Michael, No its more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of sometimes they are made of metal You know what I am talking about You unlock a little door that down where you where you put where you put the
165,5,3,Jim,32 he peed and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports And on the flip side I have been so busy watching him that I havent even started work Its exhausting being this vigilant Ill probably have to go home early today
166,5,3,Michael, I am just saying that I dont think that you understand what I am saying
167,5,3,Holly, No you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet accept the discount on supplies not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened
168,5,3,Michael, Yes
169,5,3,Holly, What am I saying
170,5,3,Michael, Well bleh busted I dont
171,5,3,Holly, Im saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I dont think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated
172,5,3,Michael, Well you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family
173,5,3,Holly, Its not a family Its a workplace
174,5,3,Michael, I will be honest with you That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I dont want to take the elevator with her And I am holding on to her leftovers 
175,5,3,Jim,  19 minutes and 48 seconds What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds
176,5,3,Dwight, None of your business
177,5,3,Jim, So I guess I can assume that was personal
178,5,3,Dwight,  Fine
179,5,3,Jim, So maybe youre not completely ethical after all
180,5,3,Dwight, Yes maybe Im not 
181,5,3,Holly, Its been a little tense People are suspicious of me And my best friend in the office wont even talk to me Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker I was just hoping middle school was over
182,5,3,Ryan, Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too
183,5,3,Michael, Whats the only thing worse than one HR rep
184,5,3,Ryan, Two HR reps
185,5,3,Michael, You get me
186,5,3,Holly, Can I sit
187,5,3,Michael, I dont know Can you Kendall my main man
188,5,3,Kendall,  Listen Holly Michael I just got the report that your branch submitted and theres a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with
189,5,3,Holly, Yes that came out during the ethics seminar
190,5,3,Michael, Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar
191,5,3,Kendall, Well Im not sure these circumstances warrant any action
192,5,3,Holly, Oh I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical
193,5,3,Kendall, Well from what I can gather it seems like a gray area Look to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I dont know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that
194,5,3,Holly, Umm Kendall I understand that the discount is good for the company but Im just not happy about the way we are getting it
195,5,3,Kendall, I thought it was clear with you Holly Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training
196,5,3,Holly, No I understand
197,5,3,Kendall, Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if its not something you can handle then thats a different discussion
198,5,3,Holly, No I can do it
199,5,3,Kendall, Good
200,5,3,Michael, How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply I told you so Gently with a rose In a funny way like its a hilarious joke Or do you just let it go because saying it would just make things worse  Probably the funny way
201,5,3,Holly, Can I have everyones attention Excuse me may I have everyones attention please We need to finish the ethics seminar
202,5,3,Andy, No way lady
203,5,3,Kevin, Its a trap
204,5,3,Holly, Everyone please I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training
205,5,3,Meredith, Dont sign anything
206,5,3,Michael, Ok everybody listen up If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kll you
207,5,3,Stanley, Its a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things
208,5,3,Michael, Get in there right now or Im gonna lose it 
209,5,3,Meredith, Am I getting fired
210,5,3,Michael, Now is really not the time Meredith
211,5,3,Holly, In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers Personal days on the other hand are much more flexible
212,5,3,Phyllis, Thank you Meredith this was delicious
213,5,3,Meredith, Hey where is the steak sauce
214,5,3,Kevin, I think were out
215,5,3,Meredith, I got some in my minivan somewhere
216,5,3,Andy, Wait a second how does the steak factor in again
217,5,3,Kevin, I think she got it as a tip but I dont know why she didnt just take cash
218,5,3,Phyllis, I dont care what shes doing I just hope she keeps doing it
219,5,3,Stanley, Amen Just keep the ribs coming

107,5,4,Holly, Good
108,5,4,Michael, Um listen Jan Levinson is coming in today and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy  the child of which I have a vested interest Its all kind of weird Anyway she is incredibly fat and enormous right now  extremely unattractive And you are on the other hand one of the more attractive people in the office So while shes here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings And Im treating Ryan the same way
109,5,4,Holly, Of course Yeah
110,5,4,Stanley, I do not like pregnant women in my workspace Theyre always complaining I have varicose veins too I have swollen ankles Im constantly hungry  do you think my nipples dont get sore too Do you think I dont need to know the fastest way to the hospital
111,5,4,Jim,  Jan
112,5,4,Jan, Hi Jim
113,5,4,Jim, What do we have here
114,5,4,Jan, This is my baby
115,5,4,Jim, Really
116,5,4,Dwight, Oh no 
117,5,4,Dwight, Jan had the baby and Michael wasnt there to mark it So the baby could be anybodys Except Michaels
118,5,4,Michael, So this is Astird
119,5,4,Jan, Astrid
120,5,4,Michael, Oh OK Why didnt you call me
121,5,4,Jan, Well um you know labor just kind of started very suddenly and
122,5,4,Michael, I could have helped
123,5,4,Jan, And the birth instructor thought it wasnt a good idea for you to be there so
124,5,4,Michael, Oh man Him That guy He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways
125,5,4,Jan, OK you dont have any idea what Ive been through so lets
126,5,4,Michael, No I dont
127,5,4,Jan, Im sorry I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet
128,5,4,Michael, Can I hold her
129,5,4,Jan, Yes yes you can You know I think just leave her in the car seat Yeah
130,5,4,Michael,  All right OK
131,5,4,Michael, I love babies I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways I try to pick up and hold a baby every day if possible because it nourishes me It feeds my soul Babies are drawn to me and I think its because they see me as one of them But cooler and with my life put together a little bit If a baby were president there would be no taxes there would be no wr There would be no government and things could get terrible It actually probably  it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion
132,5,4,Michael, Assst
133,5,4,Jan, trid
134,5,4,Michael, trid Levinson Hi Astrid this is everybody look This is your family Youre going to know them for the rest of your life

120,9,2,Pam, In Phoenix They should really tell you that more specifically I mean every game is an away game for one of the teams  Do we know everything about each other
121,9,2,Jim, No
122,9,2,Pam, Tell me one thing about you I dont know
123,9,2,Jim,  Um ok 
124,9,2,Jim,  Oh heres one Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement And bought the winning numbers the next day And then played the tape for me the next week and I
125,9,2,Pam, And you thought you guys were millionaires
126,9,2,Jim, You heard that one
127,9,2,Pam, Yes But theres wait oh theres a funny ending to that story I cant remember
128,9,2,Jim, That I thought we were millionaires
129,9,2,Pam, Thought you were millionaires yeah Thats funny sht I knew that one
130,9,2,Jim, Thats all right
131,9,2,Angela, The senator and I still have mystery Im always waiting to see what hes gonna surprise me with next 
132,9,2,Jim, You all right 
133,9,2,Nellie, You support the Taliban abroad So I assume youre willing to live by their rules here
134,9,2,Dwight, Anything else would be inconsistent
135,9,2,Nellie, Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office 
136,9,2,Dwight,  Absolutely I will
137,9,2,Dwight, I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font Huh  You dont have a plan
138,9,2,Nellie, When you use a ridiculous font no one thinks you have a plan
139,9,2,Nellie,  Looking for this
140,9,2,Dwight, What the 
141,9,2,Nellie, Oh this is a lovely pen Ah But its mine now because I stole it
142,9,2,Dwight,  Gimme that
143,9,2,Nellie, Didnt you sign a contract to live under Taliban law And now theres been theft That means youre not serious or someones getting their hand cut off
144,9,2,Dwight, Youre insane
145,9,2,Nellie, I know So its better that you pick another charity
146,9,2,Dwight, Oh and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked No thank you
147,9,2,Nellie, In that case you  will have to chop off my hand
148,9,2,Dwight,  This cleaver appears to need sharpening I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand Tie a shoe toss a salad Do any of the two hand activities that youll miss the most
149,9,2,Nellie, I tell you what I need to make three calls And then after that you can become a person who chops off peoples hands
150,9,2,Dwight, Sounds like a plan
151,9,2,Andy,  Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment
152,9,2,Erin, Yeah
153,9,2,Andy,  Clark you and I need to have a little chat What clothes does Erin need for this news audition
154,9,2,Clark, Uh couple of buttondowns a camisole a blazer a pencil skirt stilettos maybe no no not maybe definitely opentoed Uh something lowcut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut
155,9,2,Andy, Really
156,9,2,Clark, Yeah industry secret Youre gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back
157,9,2,Pete, Seems unnecessary for an audition

9,9,5,Dwight, At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently I never should have played that joke on Erin I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place Then I realized that I was being silly I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two Right

229,9,5,HCT Member #3, He reminded us today of how much he means to us And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him so without any further ado heres an old Treble classic
230,9,5,HCT, 
231,9,5,Broccoli Rob,  
232,9,5,Andy, Whoa Whoa What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here
233,9,5,HCT Member #3, She said you wanted to hear Faith Thats Broccoli Robs signature song
234,9,5,Andy, Thats my signature song
235,9,5,HCT Member #3, I really didnt know that man I just thought you wanted to hear it
236,9,5,Andy, Russell Im dressed like George Michael
237,9,5,HCT Member #3, I thought you were Adam Lambert
238,9,5,Andy, Wha
239,9,5,Erin, The more I hear about all this a capella drama the more I think its kind of pathetic But when youre with someone you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them and that is love
240,9,5,Erin, Are you okay
241,9,5,Broccoli Rob,  Hes still mad
242,9,5,Andy, Shut up Broccoli
243,9,5,Broccoli Rob, Champ I feel awful about this whole thing Russell called me up And they said they needed 20 ccs of George Michael stat So just Wham I sprang into action You know me I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number
244,9,5,Andy, You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat A mans signature solo is his for life okay Thats group policy and you know it
245,9,5,Broccoli Rob, Look its not my fault that I still live near campus and its my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys and stop in two three times a week
246,9,5,Andy, Just dont do the song anymore
247,9,5,Broccoli Rob, I tell you what well have a singoff for it You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and Ill do the same and Im so confident that Ill win I wont even warm up
248,9,5,Andy, Fine go ahead Thrash your pipes
249,9,5,Broccoli Rob, My pipes are primo Champ Why dont you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes
250,9,5,Andy, I knew you would go there you son of a bitch
251,9,5,Broccoli Rob, He said and I quote Hey Rob nice pipes That happened
252,9,5,Andy, OK fine yeah thats one guys opinion
253,9,5,Broccoli Rob, Thats real Thatll never change
254,9,5,Erin, Okay
255,9,5,Andy, Doesnt mean youre the best singer ever Dick
256,9,5,Jim, I thought that concert was pretty great
257,9,5,Kevin, Oh yeah I decided that acapelca music is awesome
258,9,5,Angela, They lost me when they sang Monster Mash That song obviously glorifies the occult
259,9,5,Jim, Angela its Halloween You have to sing Monster Mash
260,9,5,Pam, Oh you have to Jim You literally have to
261,9,5,Jim, Uh
262,9,5,Pam, No Im just Im saying what would happen if they didnt sing it Would they go to jail Would they be shot
263,9,5,Jim, Okay Well just forget it
264,9,5,Pam, No No Im interested I mean I think everybodys interested in why they have to sing it
265,9,5,Jim, Because it is Halloween So if youre going to sing a concert its a good idea to throw that one in
266,9,5,Pam, Yeah yeah no no Its a good idea to brush your teeth But you have to um feed your children Send them to school You know all things you cant do if you just keep singing Monster Mash

125,9,7,Dwight, Yes
126,9,7,Pam, Okay well you have to show us
127,9,7,Dwight, Thats impossible Listening happens in the ear and in the brain I mean some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately our external hairs dont vibrate at all
128,9,7,Pam, Huh  Uh huh
129,9,7,Dwight, What are you doing
130,9,7,Pam, A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you Got it
131,9,7,Dwight, Kind of
132,9,7,Pam, Nellie why dont you tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today And Dwight you show us that youre listening
133,9,7,Nellie, Well we were in the warehouse where we were discussing a mural that Ive commissioned Pam to paint there We were talking color schemes and the major themes we want to hit Children of the world coming together cutting down trees to make paper But not in a child labory way
134,9,7,Erin, Its just up and down just a regular nod like a person
135,9,7,Dwight, I am a person
136,9,7,Erin, Yes
137,9,7,Nellie, And then we thought wed  I cant I just cant carry on with that face Look at it Im gonna get nightmares with that face I mean he looks like hes laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh
138,9,7,Dwight, Thats a bit extreme
139,9,7,Nellie, No Im sorry but that is true

150,9,7,Pam, Ten years ago I didnt care if Dwight got married or died a beetfarming bachelor But having kids makes you so soft I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh and now Im like that poor gimp is somebodys child
151,9,7,Pam, You know I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women
152,9,7,Dwight, Look I have no problem with women Its businesswomen and their their power suits and their shoulder pads Dont lie about your shoulders
153,9,7,Pam, Dwight listen to me Businesswomen are just normal nice reasonable people Who is a nice reasonable person in your experience
154,9,7,Dwight, I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently
155,9,7,Pam, Okay so when youre selling to this woman just imagine that shes that nice reasonable barber
156,9,7,Dwight, Okay I can do that
157,9,7,Pam, Mmhmm Good Baby steps

87,9,9,Pam, Were the party planning committee and we did not get where we are by playing it safe We got here by being risk takers And yeah Dwights party is gonna be terrible Maybe Maybe its not Maybe its going to be great And if its greatI think we all know what that would mean to us
88,9,9,Phyllis, Lets do it
89,9,9,Pam, Yes Phyllis
90,9,9,Angela, No I dont want my name attached to this party
91,9,9,Pam, What does that even mean Where would your name appear
92,9,9,Angela, Please just take my name off of everything
93,9,9,Oscar, Just take her name off of everything
94,9,9,Pam,  The party planning committee minus Angela has decided that were all going to do Dwights Christmas
95,9,9,Dwight, Yes Yeah  Yeah Okay Yes Its a Christmas Miracle  Yeah WhooHoo
96,9,9,Pam, Dwight there is one rule that you need to take very seriously
97,9,9,Dwight, Uhhuh
98,9,9,Pam, And that is
99,9,9,Dwight, Uh Oh
100,9,9,Pam, That there are no rules

114,9,9,Jim, Cant wait
115,9,9,Meredith, Weird Where are the sugar cookies Wheres the karaoke machine
116,9,9,Dwight, This is austere Meredith This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions I mean most people dont even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherds Crook which I assure you does not taste like peppermint It tastes like sheep feces
117,9,9,Oscar, How would anyone even know
118,9,9,Dwight, Have you ever tasted a Shepherds Crook
119,9,9,Jim, I dont know Is it what you expected
120,9,9,Pam, I feel like Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem
121,9,9,Jim, So happy right now
122,9,9,Dwight,  Wait what is that I hear Is someone on the roof How strange  Excuse me I have to run to my car to take a dump

131,9,9,Pete, Right um okay So he says uh  After we call the police theyll waste hours trying to negotiate
132,9,9,Erin, We should just watch the movie That makes much more sense
133,9,9,Pete, Or we can just sit and talk though
134,9,9,Erin, No No more talking Its movie time
135,9,9,Pete, I mean are you sureUm yeah I probably have a copy or two in my car

148,9,9,Jim, So hes kind of like santa except dirty and worse
149,9,9,Dwight, No much betterNo one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel
150,9,9,Jim, Wow Its my favorite part of Christmas The authority
151,9,9,Pam, And the fear
152,9,9,Dwight, Yes exactly
153,9,9,Phyllis, Come on Dwight youre making this up
154,9,9,Dwight, No
155,9,9,Oscar,  This is a real thing Belsnickel is a crotchety furclad gift giver related to other companions of st Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany
156,9,9,Angela, Huh
157,9,9,Pam, Wow
158,9,9,Dwight, Okay great Seriously you guys Now you believe in Dwights traditions when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia
159,9,9,Oscar,  His partner zwarte piet or black Peter a slave boy often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface

166,9,9,Phyllis, Thank you Dwight These are nice
167,9,9,Dwight, No these are gift bowls When you recieve a gift it will go in the bowl but the bowls must be returned at the end Theyre a set Now hold your bowls forward The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable
168,9,9,Jim, Oh its like naughty or nice
169,9,9,Dwight, No impish or admirable
170,9,9,Jim, Quick questionDo you just decide who gets what in the moment or did you make a list
171,9,9,Dwight, I decided earlier
172,9,9,Jim, Oh nice Did you check that list
173,9,9,Dwight, Of course I checked it
174,9,9,Jim, But more than once cause you could have made a mistake
175,9,9,Dwight, I checked it more than once

187,9,9,Pam,  Mouse trap
188,9,9,Dwight, In a headtohead contest people prefer belsnickel over santa every time There arent as many songs about him but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties My brother and I wrote one once it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel
189,9,9,Jim, Oh you know what I gotta go

47,9,10,Dwight, Make way nope inspect me
48,9,10,Erin, Oh this is the cleanest scalp Ive ever seen You are all clear
49,9,10,Dwight, Should be I use lice shampoo every morning

51,9,10,Angela, Dwight
52,9,10,Erin, Next

64,9,10,Phyllis, What are you wearing
65,9,10,Dwight, Its a Hazmat suit That stands for hazaderous materials mens suit wearing If you rent more than four times a year it just makes sense to buy Is there anyone else here that is lice free  Excellent Do you have your own hazmat suits

70,9,10,Phyllis, You got dumped
71,9,10,Darryl, Yeah she ended things
72,9,10,Nellie, Breakups are the worst The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepards pie and Brandy The singer not the drink
73,9,10,Kevin, Here man  You need that more than me
74,9,10,Darryl, Thanks man
75,9,10,Kevin, Yeah 
76,9,10,Pam, Guys I think we should all ease up on Meredith This has got to be hard for her
77,9,10,Angela, Oh no no no no no I have not yet begun to shame
78,9,10,Stanley, Thats it Im getting my stuff Im leaving for the day

80,9,10,Stanley, Get off me
81,9,10,Erin, Im trying to save you from yourself
82,9,10,Stanley, Alright Ill stay Theres a pencil broken in my rolls
83,9,10,Pam, Maybe it was Meredith Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece So lets not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me That is how wars get started Fine Ill tell her it was me
84,9,10,Jim, Oh man thats fresh squeezed And uh are all the snacks complimentary
85,9,10,Limo Driver, Yeah take some home if you want

96,9,10,Pam, I am going to tell her but now is clearly not the time I will buy her a wig well have a few laughs Theres a right way to do this
97,9,10,Dwight, Scalp leeches skull vampires follicle gypsies hair lawyers One thing is clear its kll or be klled
98,9,10,Erin, No no Its more of a nuisance really Its not that big a deal So I collected your hats and your coats
99,9,10,Dwight, To be burned
100,9,10,Erin, To be washed
101,9,10,Angela, What do we do about our heads
102,9,10,Dwight, Im not gonna lie Lye
103,9,10,Erin, No all we need is mayonnaise
104,9,10,Angela, Excuse me
105,9,10,Pam, Shes right it works I would imagine
106,9,10,Erin, Yes it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and its a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos
107,9,10,Oscar, I can appreciate that I also only eat local organic produce
108,9,10,Meredith,  Shaboom How do you like me now
109,9,10,Angela, Oh

93,9,13,Dwight, Okay heres one A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock You cant rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party

107,9,13,Dwight, Oh you think theyre my only friends Ive got way more friends than that and theyre all better than the losers who work here
108,9,13,Stanley, This is not natural
109,9,13,Oscar, Just  I dont wanna make assumptions based on peoples physical appearances
110,9,13,Pam, Well of course not but does physical appearance include smell
111,9,13,Darryl, They smell so bad
112,9,13,Meredith, If I ever get that bad youd tell me right
113,9,13,Kevin, Meredith I tell you all the time
114,9,13,Meredith,  Walked right into that one
115,9,13,Dwight, Next up my cousin Mose Mose could make a great paper salesman Hes got a natural fear of paper which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible Ive got big expectations Mosewise
116,9,13,Dwight, What quality would make you a good sales associate
117,9,13,Mose, People person
118,9,13,Dwight, It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical
119,9,13,Mose, Thats right
120,9,13,Dwight, You know we live together right
121,9,13,Mose, Yes
122,9,13,Dwight, And Ive never seen you go to work ever
123,9,13,Mose, Okay
124,9,13,Dwight, So why is this on your resume 
125,9,13,Clark, So howd you guys hear about the position
126,9,13,Gabor, Mymy mom
127,9,13,Nate, Dwight called my house but he didnt realize that I had already moved out because my mom and I are quarrelling because I I cant stay out of her stuff
128,9,13,Zeke, Dwights my cousin so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower
129,9,13,Clark, You were in the shower or he was in the shower
130,9,13,Zeke, Everyone was in the shower Its a cow shower so theres like a ton of people in there
131,9,13,Clark, So you guys all know Dwight already
132,9,13,Melvina, I was his babysitter and then we dated for a while He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby
133,9,13,Gabor, I knew you looked familiar You used to pick up Dwight from school
134,9,13,Melvina, You went to XMen school too 
135,9,13,Clark, XMen school
136,9,13,Dwight, When I was young I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters from the XMen comic books Took me years to figure out that it was a con Some people never figured it out
137,9,13,Gabor, Oh I have a few powers Night hearing Dogs understand where I point And our training included picking carrots scrubbing tubs sewing imitation Levis A lot of telemarketing
138,9,13,Angela, I dont want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years Someone say something
139,9,13,Stanley, I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim Didnt work then And now look what hes doing to us
140,9,13,Nellie, Yeah Jim this is all your fault
141,9,13,Jim, How is it my fault
142,9,13,Nellie, Heres an exercise for you Jim Imagine there are consequences to your actions Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this There are others
143,9,13,Jim, But its Dwight whos bring in all the weirdos
144,9,13,Oscar, Yeah but Jim Dwights a weirdo We cant blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos
145,9,13,Pam, Hey Im the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jims away Im in a position where Im rooting for Nate and that just feels wrong  Forget it I need to work on my mural I have some pointy trees that I need to round off
146,9,13,David Wallace,  Hey Jim I thought our call was for later
147,9,13,Jim, Yeah this is actually about the new sales guy Uh Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos And I was wondering if I could have some input
148,9,13,Dwight,  This is Dwight Schrute Who am I speaking to And dont lie I can tell if youre lying
149,9,13,David Wallace, Hey Dwight Its David
150,9,13,Dwight, David
151,9,13,David Wallace, Jim says hed like some say in the hiring process
152,9,13,Dwight, Really Thats interesting Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time he might not be as invested in the decisionmaking process as someone like me whos here every day And frankly klling it lately
153,9,13,Jim, I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk near my wife
154,9,13,David Wallace, Jim another thing Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work
155,9,13,Jim, Oh Um
156,9,13,David Wallace, Yeah
157,9,13,Jim, Okay I cant say that thats not fair
158,9,13,Dwight, Sounds fair to me David
159,9,13,David Wallace, And I know we have a call scheduled for later 
160,9,13,Jim, Oh yeah so well just do that later
161,9,13,Dwight, No Why not do it now

189,9,13,Wolf, Its not very good
190,9,13,Dwight, I will pay you whatever it takes
191,9,13,Wolf, I think I wanna keep it now It must be pretty special if you want it so bad
192,9,13,Dwight, No you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it So here just take my money

198,9,13,Dwight, This isnt gonna work out
199,9,13,Hide, Thank you 
200,9,13,Dwight, Nate is a proven entity but not without his handicaps hearing vision basic cognition Trevor is great but I saw no fire in him today And this is a guy who loves to start fires Troy is literally one of a kind Hes a goblin or a hobbit or a kobold which is a type of gremlin And yet Im hesitant Why cant I pull the trigger on any of them
201,9,13,Dwight,  No no no I just need to tell them I just need to tell them 
202,9,13,Melvina, Do you need to be changed
203,9,13,Dwight, I do that myself now
204,9,13,Melvina, Mm Are you going to make a decision soon Ive been doubleparked for five hours Im wondering if I should move my car
205,9,13,Dwight, No youve been towed by now They tow after about 45 minutes
206,9,13,Melvina, Well the jokes on them I live right next to the tow yard All they did was save me some gas
207,9,13,Trevor, Hey man we get how difficult this is And no matter how you choose were still gonna be your friend
208,9,13,Wolf, Yeah whether its me or Troy Underbridge or Gabor or Melvina
209,9,13,Dwight, Or none of you 
210,9,13,Wolf, Yeah youd bring us all down here put us through the wringer and then choose none of us
211,9,13,Trevor, Can you imagine how insulting that would be The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you
212,9,13,Dwight, I wish I could hire all of you

89,9,14,Nellie, Well this is getting us nowhere
90,9,14,Pam, We need another approach Um we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group  Yeah I think if we could get Nate alone we could crack him
91,9,14,Dwight, We just need a pretense to talk to him We could tell him that his mother is dying That usually works on him  Nate Your mother is dying 
92,9,14,Pam, See I feel bad about that
93,9,14,Dwight, Its all right Its all right
94,9,14,Nate, So shes gonna pull through again  Thats great Can I talk to her

101,9,14,Pam, All right You can go Give him his gum
102,9,14,Dwight, Theres no gum There never was any gum
103,9,14,Nate,  Thats really rude

143,9,14,Dwight, Normally I find Pam to be a comforting if unarousing presence around the office Like a wellwatered fern But today she has tapped into this vengeful violent side And Im like wow Pam has kind of a good butt
144,9,14,Dwight, He messed with something that was important to you We need to mess with something thats important to him

158,9,14,Oscar, Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend But he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows His gardener Rogelio Or he couldve invited Rogelio But he chose me Rogelios Malaysian The son of a bitch is Malaysian

162,9,15,Clark,  Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan I mean I went all out All out I mean like everything was out the whole week
163,9,15,Kevin, He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky lemon milk Who needs him right
164,9,15,Dwight, God I just dont know what wed do I mean short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months
165,9,15,Dwight, Id like to rat out Andy Unfortunately I have a bit of a boywhocriedwolf dynamic with David Wallace Except instead of a boy Im a man And instead of a wolf I cried geneticallyengineered monster wolf
166,9,15,Nellie, Im not going to rat on him No Andy gave me a second chance So the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him Meredith why dont you
167,9,15,Meredith, Meredith Palmer aint never been called no nark Floozy Yes Alkie Check Einstein sarcastically You bet But never no nark Vomit mop Sure Floor meat Thats me Flesh hoover
168,9,15,Erin, Hey

170,9,15,Erin, Guys I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and believe me I am too But he has been through a lot and we all used to love him right So if hes gonna get in trouble just let it be his fault not ours I dont want that on my hands
171,9,15,Dwight, Fine The state hes in Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway
172,9,15,Andy,  Whats going on in here dirty players Lets get back to busting some paper rhymes Come on  Whos that girl Whos that girl Its Andy  All right Back to work
173,9,15,Pam, OK I can tell youre mad at me Do you wanna just um I dont know tell me why
174,9,15,Jim, I dont know I thought that was a little weird You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing And you intentionally left out a kind of major intimate detail I dont know Pam I guess I just feel like a chump Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy
175,9,15,Pam, I didnt tell you about the crying because I didnt want you to know how upset I was Because it wouldve stressed you out and youre always saying how much you dont want more stress
176,9,15,Jim, Yeah well Yeah OK Well then thank you Thanks to both of you
177,9,15,Pam, Its not Brians fault
178,9,15,Jim, No youre right And and Im not mad at Brian And to be honest I probably dont have any reason to be mad at all because I wasnt there So lets just forget about it
179,9,15,Pam, OK
180,9,15,Andy, I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation Any big sales or office gossip

91,9,17,German Minister,  Would you want to do the honors
92,9,17,Fannie, Oh right Uh you know I dont think we have to do this
93,9,17,Dwight, We Schrutes dont need some Harvard doctor to tell us whos alive and whos dead But there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers And when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead Out of kindness
94,9,17,Oscar,  Thats it for me 
95,9,17,Pam, I dont think we should eat Packers cupcakes We cant give him the satisfaction
96,9,17,Phyllis, I agree Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so theyre dense But theyre also really fluffy
97,9,17,Pam, We cant let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes He was awful to us And he still is How much is a cupcake 250 Is that the price of our dignity
98,9,17,Creed, 375 a cupcake actually 367 if you buy a dozen
99,9,17,Creed, I never forget a number Names In one ear and out the other Places Nope Faces Thats rich But numbers I have a gift I guess thats why Im an accountant
100,9,17,Clark, Hey man I dont think weve met Im Clark
101,9,17,Todd Packer, Oh Im Todd Oh sorry for calling you a fat little runt earlier
102,9,17,Clark, You didnt actually say that
103,9,17,Todd Packer, No Wow Im in this mode now where Im apologizing for thoughts that are in my head  Hey I have a crazy feeling  that you are really gonna like this
104,9,17,Stanley, Maybe we should eat the cupcakes Havent we done enough to Packer I mean we sent him down to Florida on a prank  And you did fire him
105,9,17,Nellie, I did I did yes And it was purely political He did nothing wrong
106,9,17,Pam, Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart
107,9,17,Angela, Do they even have a bakery anymore
108,9,17,Kevin, They do Its awful And its getting worse every day
109,9,17,Pam, So it really is just about the cupcakes
110,9,17,Andy, Wow youre right It is just about the cupcakes
111,9,17,Phyllis, So were all agreed No one touches those cupcakes
112,9,17,Meredith,  OK
113,9,17,Phyllis, OK Packer can go to hell
114,9,17,Aunt Shirley,  Thank you for coming to my funeral As I gaze at lifes big sunset I cant help but wonder where it all went wrong Youve all disappointed me greatly Fannie A single mamma in the city
115,9,17,Dwight,  Thank you
116,9,17,Aunt Shirley, Jeb A street pusher
117,9,17,Jeb, After I left the army I bought a 9acre worm farm from a Californian Turns out worm means something else out there And I am now in the business of pain management Or the smoking of pain management
118,9,17,Dwight, I cant stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer He couldve grown anything Anything in the world He used to talk about growing a peanutgrape hybrid One plant one sandwhich
119,9,17,Aunt Shirley, We cant just sit by and watch our family farm disappear So here are my terms Dwight Fannie Jeb If you come back home I will leave you my farm So there you have it
120,9,17,Fannie, Is she crazy  Dwight
121,9,17,Jeb, Buddy Buddy
122,9,17,Fannie, No no no
123,9,17,Jeb, Snap out of it Dwight
124,9,17,Dwight, Lets do this Lets run Aunt Shirleys farm Im in Boom
125,9,17,Fannie, No no no Im not moving back here Are you crazy
126,9,17,Dwight, Of course you are
127,9,17,Fannie, Look I I dont want to be mean or like insulting I know that you like it here But Dwight its just that farm life lacks a certain sort of sophistication
128,9,17,Dwight, Oh my god
129,9,17,Fannie, That Cammy and I are drawn to And I dont know The men are just its almost like theres a a willing ignorance
130,9,17,Fannie, Yes I thank you for asking me I actually have written a little bit of poetry Thats crazy And I was recently published Which is just  maybe I have Yep I do Here it is from the um Hartford Womens Lit Quarterlycom A Willing Ignorance by Fannie Schrute
131,9,17,Jeb, Totally Yep The people here are like  Like a fart You know what Im saying Like a fart
132,9,17,Dwight, You know what Lets take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirleys offer
133,9,17,Jeb, Couple of nights couldnt hurt
134,9,17,Fannie, Uh somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt
135,9,17,Dwight, You will say yes on one Five four three two get ready to say yes one Yes
136,9,17,Zeke,  Absolutely
137,9,17,Zeke, Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy Uh Dwight was obviously the cool one And Mose was the visionary Which left me to be the comedian
138,9,17,Fannie, That doesnt work on me
139,9,17,Dwight, OK
140,9,17,Fannie, By the way thats not
141,9,17,Dwight, 
142,9,17,Fannie, Very funny OK Oui oui oui
143,9,17,Dwight, Oui

135,9,19,Pam, He took this job in Philly without telling me He bought our house without telling me At a certain point heshouldntbe rewarded for that
136,9,19,Jim, If I didnt do certain things without telling Pam shed be married to Roy

34,9,20,Pam, And were also supposed to speak our truths
35,9,20,Jim, Mmhm

44,9,21,Andy, Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating cooking or singing shows I got a real shot here And Ill never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job No offense
45,9,21,David Wallace, So you think youve been too focused on your job
46,9,21,Andy, At my last head shot sitting I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic And I was going for zany

98,9,21,Dwight, He will now perform the ceremonial cuttingoffofthebelt
99,9,21,Angela, Dwight has been practicing karate for years When we were dating I would help him with his strength training He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm It felt like I was flying
100,9,21,Dwight, There it is 
101,9,21,Sensei, Congratulations
102,9,21,Dwight, We did it we did it I love you

109,9,21,Sensei, Im watching
110,9,21,Dwight, Watch this part okay
111,9,21,David Wallace, Sensei do you generally do house calls like this
112,9,21,Sensei, Uh you can just call me Billy And no No but Dwight insisted He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world
113,9,21,David Wallace, He said that Hes an odd guy isnt he
114,9,21,Sensei, Yes Irritating also yes But I gotta hand it to him hes one of the most tenacious and determined men Ive ever met 
115,9,21,Esther, Oh Im am so proud of you Schruberry blue
116,9,21,Jim, I really felt like I almost lost her andand nothing is worth that
117,9,21,David Wallace, Well I gotta tell you Jim a lot of guys in my circle They wouldnt even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals
118,9,21,Clark, Dude there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam
119,9,21,Dwight, You did not just say that You dont know Pam She is really cool
120,9,21,Clark, All Im saying is forget about my chair He wants the managers chair And I thought you wanted that job
121,9,21,Dwight, Yeah I did But I made too many mistakes Its out of my reach now Besides I think Jim would be a fine manager Id be happy to see Jim as manager
122,9,21,David Wallace, So the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on
123,9,21,Jim, Again
124,9,21,David Wallace, Again And Im looking for a new manager And with his performance this year I have been considering Dwight Am I crazy
125,9,21,Jim, Not at all It should be Dwight
126,9,21,David Wallace, You sure
127,9,21,Jim, Youre gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance but uh
128,9,21,David Wallace, Yeah
129,9,21,Jim, Hey if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight I definitely dont want to meet that person
130,9,21,Nellie, Andy we just wondered if we could have a word
131,9,21,Andy, Its now or never
132,9,21,Nellie, Well we just had a quick question about this decision of yours You know to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business In your late 30s With no savings to fall back on And no real connections in that business which can be competitive
133,9,21,Andy, Yeah sure Whats your question
134,9,21,Kevin, Our question isit seems dumb
135,9,21,Andy, Well its better than sticking around here and halfassing it right
136,9,21,Nellie, Of course But what if you were to stay here you know and fullass it Um really give it a go Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek Hmm
137,9,21,Andy, Nah I like my plan better
138,9,21,Kevin, Well Andy your plan sucks okay Nobody is going to hire you ever Youre too charactery to be a lead and youre not fat enough to be a great character actor
139,9,21,Andy, What
140,9,21,Oscar, No I dont think that he can make it as an actor But he also cant make it as an employee in an office so why not go nuts with it
141,9,21,Jim, Hey are you still in charge of office supplies
142,9,21,Pam, Yes Yeah
143,9,21,Jim, I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end and this happens
144,9,21,Pam, Oh boy Um
145,9,21,Jim, If you could help me out that would be
146,9,21,Pam, I could give you some beginner stickies
147,9,21,Jim, Anything would help
148,9,21,Pam, Here you go
149,9,21,Jim, Oh also while youre at it if you did have a salt packet three tacks and some aspirin that would be great Oh wow You have that
150,9,21,Pam, Mmhmm
151,9,21,Jim, Wow thats
152,9,21,Pam, Its all yours
153,9,21,Jim, You come so prepared Aspirin
154,9,21,Dwight, You wanna get rid of a headache you sit on something sharp Any sensei will tell you that
155,9,21,Jim, Hey congratulations on that black belt man Its really great
156,9,21,Dwight, Thank you So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier Is he going to offer you the managers job
157,9,21,Jim, No He was maybe thinking of you for it
158,9,21,Dwight, Yeah right Im afraid that ship has sailed
159,9,21,Jim, I wouldnt be too sure about that Just saying
160,9,21,Dwight, Hello

169,9,21,Andy, Thank you I appreciate that Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it
170,9,21,Dwight, Oh I doubt youll make it Very few do whove tried to be a star But listen youve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun right
171,9,21,Andy, No I just applied for more overdraft protection
172,9,21,Dwight, Andy I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay and everything to gain from you leaving But please I have known you for years I have seen you perform Dear god dont quit your day job
173,9,21,Andy,  Nothing is impossible to him who will try  Alexander the Great if he were cockney
174,9,21,Dwight, Youre bad

403,9,22/23,Dwight, I believe that boy may be a Schrute And if he is that child needs to be accorded what is his An enormous farm an inheritance and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions You will of course be compensated with a marriage proposal
404,9,22/23,Angela, How thoughtful
405,9,22/23,Dwight, Then the two of you would move to my 1600acre estate which lets face it is a big step up from living in a gay mans closet

407,9,22/23,Dwight, Very well

429,9,22/23,Jim, I dont know what you want me to tell you man All I know is that every time Ive been faced with a tough decision theres only one thing that outweighs every other concern One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew every instinct every rational calculation
430,9,22/23,Dwight, Some sort of virus
431,9,22/23,Jim, Love
432,9,22/23,Dwight, Oh
433,9,22/23,Jim, no matter what happens you gotta forget about all the other stuff You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman whos gonna make all this worth it At the end of the day you gotta jump You love Angela Dwight I think you always have

285,9,24/25,Man 1, How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv
286,9,24/25,David Wallace, Its like seeing a documentary about how your food is made Its kinda disgusting You learn a lot but I didnt wanna know any of it
287,9,24/25,Dwight, With todays modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather its our government or the government of other countries aka Google You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were
288,9,24/25,Pete, Uh no one recognizes me But not all my friends call me Plop So thanks PBS
289,9,24/25,Woman 1, Uh Jim that DVD in the last episode was so romantic And um I think wed all love to know Pam what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead
290,9,24/25,Pam, Well I mean How do you pay back someone for something like that But uh I dont know Im working on something
291,9,24/25,Jim, She pays me back every day just by being my wife so thats fine
292,9,24/25,All, Awww
293,9,24/25,Jim, OKay
294,9,24/25,Woman 2, All I can say is if I had Jim he would have a free pass to do anything I mean if I lucked into that he could do anything Anything
295,9,24/25,Pam,  Im sorry Is there a question
296,9,24/25,Woman 2, Uh no
297,9,24/25,Man 2, Pam what was in that teapot letter
298,9,24/25,Pam, Oh um well you know I I just I just think I would rather keep that private You know if youd been filmed for nine years of your life thered be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself
299,9,24/25,Man 2, I hear ya What did it say
300,9,24/25,Moderator, Were gonna move on Next question please
301,9,24/25,Man 3, Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobodys actually filming you anymore
302,9,24/25,Toby, Yes
303,9,24/25,Woman 3, I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed Was it accurate
304,9,24/25,Meredith, I got a beef with that Um for the first seven years I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didnt show it Yes I was getting hammered but hey it was college
305,9,24/25,Woman 4, I have a question for Jim and Pam Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how youre soul mates So Pam how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia
306,9,24/25,Jim, Um you know what I actually didnt handle that move uh very gracefully From not communicating to being a little selfish
307,9,24/25,Pam, Listen um I was scared you know I loved what I had and I didnt want to risk it And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too Which was wrong because hes shown me time and again But when the documentary started airing people on the street told me that I had this fairytale romance But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale But then it got deeper and it got stronger and now its better than a fairy tale Its like a long book that you never want to end And youre fine with that because you just never ever wanna leave it
308,9,24/25,Woman 4, Like Harry Potter
309,9,24/25,Pam, Yeah like Harry Potter
310,9,24/25,Joan, I have a question for Erin
311,9,24/25,Erin, Really
312,9,24/25,Joan, Yes Um the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother
313,9,24/25,Erin, Thank you
314,9,24/25,Joan, So my question is um do dont you hate her I mean I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her
315,9,24/25,Erin, Maybe sometimes But not like hate hate More just like Mom I hate you And then she would say go to your room young lady And Id stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room which is really cool And then wed just have dinner together But I dont know Id have to meet her Thanks
316,9,24/25,Joan, Erin
317,9,24/25,Erin, Yes

457,9,24/25,Woman, Oh thats for PBS executives only
458,9,24/25,Stanley, I had to pledge 50 to my local PBS station just to get this
459,9,24/25,David Wallace, I think your ideas are fantastic Oscar Id love to contribute to your campaign
460,9,24/25,Oscar, Thank you David
461,9,24/25,Pam, Uh could I please have your attention So a year ago I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paperwhich was just some trees and stuff And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning But it all worked out for the best because I think that Ive painted the perfect thing which is the history of us All of us And this is for you Jim  And go ahead 
462,9,24/25,Pam, Everyone Lets take our picture in front of the mural Oh um I justI kind of meant just everybody from the office
463,9,24/25,Photographer,  Very nice Just a couple dozen more Smiles everybody smiles All right thats great I got enough Thank you everybody
464,9,24/25,Jim,  Lets go outside
465,9,24/25,Pam, Okay
466,9,24/25,Stanley, Okay I need a drink

468,9,24/25,Meredith, Hey bottom drawer
469,9,24/25,Kevin, Yes
470,9,24/25,Pam,  Dunder Mifflin This is Pam Oh Im sorry Jim Halpert doesnt work here anymore
471,9,24/25,Pam, I didnt watch the whole documentary After a few episodes it was too painful I kept wanting to scream at Pam It took me so long to do so many important things Its just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him Itd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes Not that Im a tragic person Im really happy now Butit would justjust make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself be strong trust yourself love yourself Conquer your fears Just go after what you want and act fast because life just isnt that long
472,9,24/25,Kevin, If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience its that if you film anybody long enough theyre going to do something stupid Its only human natural
473,9,24/25,Dwight, Hey guys
474,9,24/25,Angela, Hi
475,9,24/25,All, Hey

481,9,24/25,Kevin, What is it
482,9,24/25,Andy,  Youre probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark What will you be known for It might surprise you to learn
483,9,24/25,Pam, I finally feel ready Athlead is growing
484,9,24/25,Jim, Athleap

487,9,24/25,Jim, Dwight come on Dont end on a bad note
488,9,24/25,Dwight, Dont be an idiot Its for the severance The best I can do one month for every year youve been here Thats the max
489,9,24/25,Pam, Thanks Dwight
490,9,24/25,Jim, Hey and if youre ever in Austin
491,9,24/25,Dwight, Woah Right For what the art The music The incredible nightlife No thank you But if youre ever in the area youll always have a place to stayin my barn
492,9,24/25,Jim, There it is
493,9,24/25,Dwight, Do I get along with my coworkers Well first of all I dont have coworkers anymore I have subordinates So have I gotten along with my subordinates Lets see My supplier relations rep Meredith Palmer is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead Oscar Martinez my accountant is now godfather to my son Angela Schrute my former accountant is now my wife My top salesman Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend Soyes Id say I have gotten along with my subordinates
494,9,24/25,Andy, Oh I can so just sit here and cry
495,9,24/25,Kevin, Oh Yes
496,9,24/25,Darryl, You did good Real good
497,9,24/25,Andy, Thanks DadDarryl
498,9,24/25,Andy, I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals my college a cappella group The weird thing is now Im exactly where I wanna be I got my dream job at Cornell and Im still just thinking about my old pals Only now theyre the ones I made here I wish there was a way to know youre in the good old days before youve actually left them  Someone should write a song about that
499,9,24/25,Oscar, You take something ordinary like a piece of paper Its not much But if you see it in the right wayAnd thats what you did with this documentary But seriously you made a nineyear documentary and you couldnt once show me doing my origami
500,9,24/25,Creed,  Uhohh
501,9,24/25,Creed,  I saw a friend today It had been a while And we forgot each others names But it didnt matter Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same
502,9,24/25,Jim, Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life You could see yourself change and make mistakesand grow up You could watch yourself fall in love watch yourself become a husband become a father You guys gave that to me And thatsan amazing gift
503,9,24/25,Phyllis, Hey Jim remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics It was awesome
504,9,24/25,Jim, Thanks Phyl
505,9,24/25,Creed, I still have my medal from that
506,9,24/25,Angela, Do you even have a mattress
507,9,24/25,Creed, No but I still have my medal from that
508,9,24/25,Kevin, Oscar Oscar  I think Im gay
509,9,24/25,Oscar, Why do you say that
510,9,24/25,Kevin,  Its just that Im so emotional
511,9,24/25,Oscar, Yeah but youre not gay Youre not gay
512,9,24/25,Kevin, No but maybe the reason
513,9,24/25,Oscar, Youre not gay
514,9,24/25,Creed,  And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow I think I must have known them somewhere once before
515,9,24/25,Erin, How did you do it How did you capture what it was really like How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day How did you do it Also how do cameras work
516,9,24/25,Darryl, Everyday when I came into work all I wanted to do was leave So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now
517,9,24/25,Creed, It all seems so very arbitrary I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring I took a desk at the back because it was empty But no matter how you get there or where you end up human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home  Lets do this
518,9,24/25,Meredith, I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks theyre the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder Youre not alone sister Lets get a beer sometime
519,9,24/25,Phyllis, Im happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down
520,9,24/25,Jim, I sold paper at this company for 12 years My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper Even if I didnt love every minute of it everything I have I owe to this job This stupidwonderfulboringamazing job
521,9,24/25,Pam, I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary But all in allI think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary Theres a lot of beauty in ordinary things Isnt that kind of the point
